__EFI Narrative and Computational Text Analysis Notebooks__

This repository includes all coding material for the Narrative and Computational Text Analysis course, part of the MSc Future Narrative at the Edinburgh Future Institute.  The notebooks include:

- an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Python
- a lesson on using Regular Expressions to convert textual data into a structured format
- a lesson on sentiment analysis applied to text
- a lesson on API search and the analysis of textual results 

The data used in the RegEx and Sentiment Analyis notebooks is the transcript of the ["Babysitting, Act Three: Yes There Is A Baby"](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/175/babysitting) podcast on This American Life, by Ira Glass, 175, 05/01/2021.

These lessons were created by Dr. Beatrice Alex (co-organiser of the course). Dr. Anouk Lang provided valuable feedback and input on the notebooks.
