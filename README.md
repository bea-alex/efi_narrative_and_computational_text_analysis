__EFI Narrative and Computational Text Analysis Notebooks__

This repository includes all coding material for the Narrative and Computational Text Analysis course, part of the MSc Future Narrative at the Edinburgh Future Institute.  The notebooks include:

- an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Python
- a lesson on using Regular Expressions to convert textual data into a structured format
- a lesson on Sentiment Analysis applied to text
- a lesson on API search and the analysis of textual results 

The data used in the RegEx and Sentiment Analyis notebooks is the transcript of the ["Babysitting, Act Three: Yes There Is A Baby"](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/175/babysitting) podcast on This American Life, by Ira Glass, 175, 05/01/2021.

The notebook on API Search uses the [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov) (ISSN 2475-2703) API.  A subset of the Library of Congress, Chronicling America provides access to information about historical newspapers and their digitised newspaper pages and text.

These lessons were created by Dr Beatrice Alex (co-organiser of the course). Dr. Dr Anouk Lang (the other course organiser) provided valuable feedback and input on the notebooks.
