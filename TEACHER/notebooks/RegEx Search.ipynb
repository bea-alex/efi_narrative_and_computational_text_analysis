    "## 1. What are Regular Expressions and what are they useful for?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Expression:** A regular expression (or RegEx) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" words in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use regular expressions for word frequency analysis (e.g. to find all mentions of the words ```woman``` or ```women```, to explore you dataset and see how particular vocabulary is used in context or to transform your dataset into a particular structure. Regular expression are a way to be a bit vague about text while being incredibly specific at the same time. The examples below will explain what we mean by that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to construct Regular Expressions. E.g., you can use a wildcard * or you can use a range of letters, e.g., [ae] (for a or e), [a-z] (for a to z), or numbers, e.g., [0-9] (for all single digits) etc. Regular Expressions can be very powerful if used correctly. For example, to find all mentions of the words woman or women you need to use the following Regular Expression: wom[ae]n.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will give you a taster for using regular expressions and some examples. For a more detailed overview of Regular Expressions, you can refer to the Programming Historian lesson 'Understanding Regular Expressions' at https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/understanding-regular-expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Building a Regular Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's stick with our example and let's imagine we want to see all tokens that refer to `women` in text. As human beings we know that this includes both the singlular `woman` and plural `women`. Computers need us to be very very specific, and so regular expressions provided us with a way to capture such small, acceptable differences when searching text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we arrive at a Regular Expression is a process of specifying what we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could say: give me all occurances of `woman` and `women` and then add them all.\n",
    "- I could say: give me all occurances of `wom*n` where `*` is `a` or `e`. \n",
    "- I could use a RegEx to say give me all occurances of `wom[ae]n`.\n",
    "- I could use a RegEx to say give me all exact matches of `^wom[ae]n$` which also means that there can be nothing before or after these characters, so `superwomen` and `womenhood` will not be included."
