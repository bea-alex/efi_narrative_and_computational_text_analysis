    "## 1. What are Regular Expressions and what are they useful for?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Expression:** A regular expression (or RegEx) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" words in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use regular expressions for word frequency analysis (e.g. to find all mentions of the words ```woman``` or ```women```, to explore you dataset and see how particular vocabulary is used in context or to transform your dataset into a particular structure. Regular expression are a way to be a bit vague about text while being incredibly specific at the same time. The examples below will explain what we mean by that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to construct Regular Expressions. E.g., you can use a wildcard * or you can use a range of letters, e.g., [ae] (for a or e), [a-z] (for a to z), or numbers, e.g., [0-9] (for all single digits) etc. Regular Expressions can be very powerful if used correctly. For example, to find all mentions of the words woman or women you need to use the following Regular Expression: wom[ae]n.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will give you a taster for using regular expressions and some examples. For a more detailed overview of Regular Expressions, you can refer to the Programming Historian lesson 'Understanding Regular Expressions' at https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/understanding-regular-expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Building a Regular Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's stick with our example and let's imagine we want to see all tokens that refer to `women` in text. As human beings we know that this includes both the singlular `woman` and plural `women`. Computers need us to be very very specific, and so regular expressions provided us with a way to capture such small, acceptable differences when searching text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we arrive at a Regular Expression is a process of specifying what we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could say: give me all occurances of `woman` and `women` and then add them all.\n",
    "- I could say: give me all occurances of `wom*n` where `*` is `a` or `e`. \n",
    "- I could use a RegEx to say give me all occurances of `wom[ae]n`.\n",
    "- I could use a RegEx to say give me all exact matches of `^wom[ae]n$` which also means that there can be nothing before or after these characters, so `superwomen` and `womenhood` will not be included."

      "@Ira Glass\tThis is a story that caught our interest because of babysitting, but then it ended up being about so many other things besides. A man in Florida named Myron Jones wrote us this letter. He said that when he was 16 years old, growing up without a dad in Buffalo, New York, he was allowed to stay out till midnight.  He came and went as he pleased. Spent a lot of time in bars, actually. This was the 1940s. But his sister Carol, she had different rules, and she wasn't let out of the house at all, even though she was older than Myron. This story gets to babysitting in a big, big way. And I called him to talk about it.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tShe had to say exactly where she was going, who she was going with. She could go to church dances, but only some church dances. It all had to do with protecting her chastity, really.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIf one were to ask your mother at the time, what would she have said?  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tShe said you've got to be more careful with the girls.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tYeah.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tSpelled P-R-E-G-N-A-N-T. So my sister figured out a little scheme. She invented a family called the McCrearys. Said they needed her to babysit. And I remember when she first told me about it. She said listen, guess what I did, I made up a family. I said what do you mean? I made up this family I babysit for, they're called the McCrearys.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIt seemed clear once I got talking to Myron Jones that his sister Carol, might have a few thoughts about all this. And we gave her a call. She agreed to go into a studio and chat. She says if anything, her brother was understanding just how strict the mother was with her.  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tShe used to follow me. She had a friend. We called them Sam Spade and the fat man. And they would follow us. And then I'd go home, and she'd come in and say where have you been. It was-- it was really, really hard. She didn't believe anything I ever said.  \n",

So the man in the family was an FBI agent, working on a top secret project, so he could not give his phone number to anyone at all. He also couldn't let anyone but my sister, the babysitter, know just where they lived. It would have been dangerous for him to do so.  \n",

Sometimes the little boy in particular would try to test us. And I'd let him get away with it. But my sister wouldn't. And they had all kinds of toys, but not too many toys.

So my mother would accept this quite readily, you know, that they wanted the both of us out at the lake. It was wonderful. We had such a good summer. I mean, it was glorious.  \n",

      "@Carol Jones\tI still remember what that was like. It offered freedom that was just so wonderful to me.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tWe really got all of this from our mother, this notion of fantasy people. Our mother had, from the time we were young kids, younger than 10, our mother had three people that she went to see. None of them existed, and we always knew they didn't exist.  \n",

At the end of the summer, it was the last weekend. And that was near the real change in the McCreary time.  \n",

And we could tell before we turned the corner that our mother was outside the door, waiting for us. And we turned, and there she was. And she looked ready to kill. She looked absolutely furious. She said well, where you too been? And I though, oh, god, she found out all about the summer cottage stuff.  And Carol said, you know where we've been, ma, at the McCrearys. And my mother said, oh, yeah. Well, you're a couple of damn liars. I just got off the phone with Mrs. McCreary. She hasn't seen you in weeks.  \n",

      "@Ira Glass\tDid she often claimed that she had run into the McCrearys?  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tYes, that she'd talked to her, that she hadn't seen me. She did it so often. She believed this. It was amazing, but she never questioned these things.  \n",

      "@Myron Jones\tNo, my sister and I-- I think because of, because of going away to school when I was so young-- let me back up a little bit. When I was nine, I came home on a Saturday afternoon, and my mother said, I'm sorry you weren't here, because Father Sager, who was an Episcopal priest, was here visiting. And he found a very nice orphanage for you.  And I said, but I'm not an orphan, Ma. She said, no, I know. I told Father Sager that. But he said, really you are, because I have to work all the time, and there's no one to take care of you. And I said, well, we take care of ourselves. And she said, I need to tell Father Sager that, but he said, not really. You go there, it'll be a good place for you. You go there.  I was close to-- I was in my 30s before I understood why I went away to school when I was 10. I didn't have to. I could have not gone. I could have screwed up the test. I could have gone and gotten kicked out right away. I knew that. One of the things that our mother did with us, from the time we were very young.  I can't remember before, but I know before I went to school, my mother used to say to us, when your father died, everybody told me to put the two of you in an orphanage. I didn't, and that was the biggest mistake of my life. So when the day came, I came home, and she said, Father Sager found an orphanage for you, what I really did was say, you've been threatening me with this all my life, and now, damn it, I'm going to go.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tYeah.  \n",

And after six weeks, I went home. And I was-- it was late October, already dark in Buffalo, and around supper time. And I was walking down the street, and I loved my neighborhood. I knew everybody. I looked, and the lights were on, thinking it's warm in there. That's people-- that's Sonny Calucci's house. That's his house. They're in there. And I have a house too.  I go to school now, but I have a house too. And I'm almost there. And I walked in the door, and I started to hug my mother. And my mother put out her hand to hold me back, and said, now, let me ask you a question. When you're up there at that fancy school, do you ever think about your mother, lying here in bed, crying her eyes out every single night? You ever think about that? Nah, you never think about anybody but yourself. And I literally from that moment on have never asked my mother for anything, never looked to her for anything.  \n",

      "@Carol Jones\tOne time, when I was 35, I lashed out at her in such a way, and told her how I felt about her, and she sat in a chair in the kitchen, and she was crying. And I had never even seen her cry before. And when I finally stopped talking, she said, I did the very best I could. And I thought, oh, my god, she did. Her best was so bad. Her best was so empty. But she couldn't do any better.  I decided, and it helps me a lot-- I have a great aunt that I just adored, and her mother, my mother's mother, who was wonderful, and my great-grandmother, who I didn't know, but who adored my mother, my mother slept in bed with her, I thought I'm going to do this for the people that loved her, you know, all of the people that really loved this little girl, I'm going to do it for them.

It turns out her mom didn't actually buy that baseball glove for Myron. Their uncle bought the glove. And when it arrived at the house wrapped as a gift, Myron's mom intercepted it, gave it to him, and pretended it was from her all along. Carol lives in California.

      "@Ira Glass\tThis is a story that caught our interest because of babysitting, but then it ended up being about so many other things besides. A man in Florida named Myron Jones wrote us this letter. He said that when he was 16 years old, growing up without a dad in Buffalo, New York, he was allowed to stay out till midnight.  He came and went as he pleased. Spent a lot of time in bars, actually. This was the 1940s. But his sister Carol, she had different rules, and she wasn't let out of the house at all, even though she was older than Myron. This story gets to babysitting in a big, big way. And I called him to talk about it.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tShe had to say exactly where she was going, who she was going with. She could go to church dances, but only some church dances. It all had to do with protecting her chastity, really.  \n",

      "@Ira Glass\tYeah.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tSpelled P-R-E-G-N-A-N-T. So my sister figured out a little scheme. She invented a family called the McCrearys. Said they needed her to babysit. And I remember when she first told me about it. She said listen, guess what I did, I made up a family. I said what do you mean? I made up this family I babysit for, they're called the McCrearys.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIt seemed clear once I got talking to Myron Jones that his sister Carol, might have a few thoughts about all this. And we gave her a call. She agreed to go into a studio and chat. She says if anything, her brother was understanding just how strict the mother was with her.  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tShe used to follow me. She had a friend. We called them Sam Spade and the fat man. And they would follow us. And then I'd go home, and she'd come in and say where have you been. It was-- it was really, really hard. She didn't believe anything I ever said.  \n",

When I was nine, I came home on a Saturday afternoon, and my mother said, I'm sorry you weren't here, because Father Sager, who was an Episcopal priest, was here visiting. And he found a very nice orphanage for you.  And I said, but I'm not an orphan, Ma. She said, no, I know. I told Father Sager that. But he said, really you are, because I have to work all the time, and there's no one to take care of you. And I said, well, we take care of ourselves. And she said, I need to tell Father Sager that, but he said, not really. You go there, it'll be a good place for you. You go there.  I was close to-- I was in my 30s before I understood why I went away to school when I was 10. I didn't have to. I could have not gone. I could have screwed up the test. I could have gone and gotten kicked out right away. I knew that. One of the things that our mother did with us, from the time we were very young.  I can't remember before, but I know before I went to school, my mother used to say to us, when your father died, everybody told me to put the two of you in an orphanage. I didn't, and that was the biggest mistake of my life. So when the day came, I came home, and she said, Father Sager found an orphanage for you, what I really did was say, you've been threatening me with this all my life, and now, damn it, I'm going to go.  \n",

And after six weeks, I went home. And I was-- it was late October, already dark in Buffalo, and around supper time. And I was walking down the street, and I loved my neighborhood. I knew everybody. I looked, and the lights were on, thinking it's warm in there. That's people-- that's Sonny Calucci's house. That's his house. They're in there. And I have a house too.  I go to school now, but I have a house too. And I'm almost there. And I walked in the door, and I started to hug my mother. And my mother put out her hand to hold me back, and said, now, let me ask you a question. When you're up there at that fancy school, do you ever think about your mother, lying here in bed, crying her eyes out every single night? You ever think about that? Nah, you never think about anybody but yourself. And I literally from that moment on have never asked my mother for anything, never looked to her for anything.  \n",

I decided, and it helps me a lot-- I have a great aunt that I just adored, and her mother, my mother's mother, who was wonderful, and my great-grandmother, who I didn't know, but who adored my mother, my mother slept in bed with her, I thought I'm going to do this for the people that loved her, you know, all of the people that really loved this little girl, I'm going to do it for them.

A man in Florida named Myron Jones wrote us this letter. He said that when he was 16 years old, growing up without a dad in Buffalo, New York, he was allowed to stay out till midnight.  He came and went as he pleased. Spent a lot of time in bars, actually. This was the 1940s. But his sister Carol, she had different rules, and she wasn't let out of the house at all, even though she was older than Myron. This story gets to babysitting in a big, big way. And I called him to talk about it.\n",

And my mother said, oh, yeah. Well, you're a couple of damn liars. I just got off the phone with Mrs. McCreary. She hasn't seen you in weeks.\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tMy brother and I agree, we didn't breathe. We thought, oh, my god, she's talked to them. And then as quickly, we realized, of course she didn't talk to them.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tCarol got over it immediately, and said, sorry, Ma. Nice try. We just left the McCrearys 10 minutes ago. Went in the house. She didn't say anything to us, we didn't say anything to her. And after that, we really stopped talking about the McCrearys.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tDid she often claimed that she had run into the McCrearys?\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tYes, that she'd talked to her, that she hadn't seen me. She did it so often. She believed this. It was amazing, but she never questioned these things.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWhy do you think she didn't question it?\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tI think she wanted it to be true, probably as much as I did.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIt's interesting, when you invented-- when you invented them, it's as if you invented them in terms that would reassure your mom.\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tYeah, I probably did. I don't think that-- well, you know, it did. I'm sure it did occur to me that I wanted a family that would please her.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIs that because-- is that because it would make her more likely to let you out? Or was there a part of it where you also were the kind of kid where you always needed to be reassuring her anyway?\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tOh, I had to constantly reassure her, always. I mean, it isn't something I talk easily about, but she really never liked me. That was the problem.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIs your mom still alive?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tYeah.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tSo how old is she now?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\t94.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tHow old are you?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tI'm going to be 70 in another 10 days.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tSo have you ever come clean with her on this?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tOh, no, never. Do you want me to make my mother look like a liar?\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIn the sense, you already have. It's just a question of whether she's going to know it.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tRight. No, it never crossed my mind to do it.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tAre you serious? It's never crossed your mind?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tTo tell her? No, never.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tBecause she wouldn't be able to laugh about it, it sounds like.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tNot in any way. She might simply say that we were lying now, that there were McCrearys and we were just saying that for some reason.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tDoes it make you sad that you can't have the kind of relationship with your mom, where now that everyone's an adult, you know, you can't come straight with all of it?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tNo, my sister and I-- I think because of, because of going away to school when I was so young-- let me back up a little bit. When I was nine, I came home on a Saturday afternoon, and my mother said, I'm sorry you weren't here, because Father Sager, who was an Episcopal priest, was here visiting. And he found a very nice orphanage for you.  And I said, but I'm not an orphan, Ma. She said, no, I know. I told Father Sager that. But he said, really you are, because I have to work all the time, and there's no one to take care of you. And I said, well, we take care of ourselves. And she said, I need to tell Father Sager that, but he said, not really. You go there, it'll be a good place for you. You go there.  I was close to-- I was in my 30s before I understood why I went away to school when I was 10. I didn't have to. I could have not gone. I could have screwed up the test. I could have gone and gotten kicked out right away. I knew that. One of the things that our mother did with us, from the time we were very young.  I can't remember before, but I know before I went to school, my mother used to say to us, when your father died, everybody told me to put the two of you in an orphanage. I didn't, and that was the biggest mistake of my life. So when the day came, I came home, and she said, Father Sager found an orphanage for you, what I really did was say, you've been threatening me with this all my life, and now, damn it, I'm going to go.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tYeah.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tAnd it felt safer. I was scared as hell. I was one of two kids in the sixth grade. The other kid never showed up. I went to all classes alone for six weeks. And after six weeks, I went home. And I was-- it was late October, already dark in Buffalo, and around supper time. And I was walking down the street, and I loved my neighborhood. I knew everybody. I looked, and the lights were on, thinking it's warm in there. That's people-- that's Sonny Calucci's house. That's his house. They're in there. And I have a house too.  I go to school now, but I have a house too. And I'm almost there. And I walked in the door, and I started to hug my mother. And my mother put out her hand to hold me back, and said, now, let me ask you a question. When you're up there at that fancy school, do you ever think about your mother, lying here in bed, crying her eyes out every single night? You ever think about that? Nah, you never think about anybody but yourself. And I literally from that moment on have never asked my mother for anything, never looked to her for anything.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tHow old were you then?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tI was 10.\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tThrough the years, I have truly envied him that he has been able to do that, and that I have been unable to do that, not believing that I'm going to get anything from her. I know I haven't. But I have never, I haven't been able to this moment to just take her out of my life completely.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tHow often do you see her now?\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tDo I see her?\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tYeah.\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tI'm now seeing her twice a week. I mean, I call her every night, which is all something to do with me. Because she doesn't know that I call her every night.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tBecause she's becoming senile?\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tYes.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWhat do you think you've gotten by being the one caring for her?\n",
      "@Carol Jones\tOne time, when I was 35, I lashed out at her in such a way, and told her how I felt about her, and she sat in a chair in the kitchen, and she was crying. And I had never even seen her cry before. And when I finally stopped talking, she said, I did the very best I could. And I thought, oh, my god, she did. Her best was so bad. Her best was so empty. But she couldn't do any better.  I decided, and it helps me a lot-- I have a great aunt that I just adored, and her mother, my mother's mother, who was wonderful, and my great-grandmother, who I didn't know, but who adored my mother, my mother slept in bed with her, I thought I'm going to do this for the people that loved her, you know, all of the people that really loved this little girl, I'm going to do it for them. And it feels-- that feels fine to me.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tYou know what you're describing is you and your sister going off and pretending to babysit for these imaginary kids. But in fact, you guys had a babysitting job, and it was for your mom.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tThat's right. My sister was the chief babysitter. It's true.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tAt the time, when you were kids, did you-- when you were kids, did you ever see it that way? Oh, we're taking care of mom. She thinks she's taking care of us, but we're taking care of her?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tOh, yeah. There was a kind of humoring her, and placating her. And when I was about 10, she gave me a first baseman's glove, because I was going to be a major league ball player when I grew up. And she said, you tell people who gave you the glove? I said yeah. You tell them how much it cost? I didn't, but I said, yeah. She said, you tell them how long I had to work to buy that? I said, yeah. She said, you did not.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tLet's set the record straight. Here we go, you're on the radio. How long did your mother have to work to buy you the baseball glove?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tShe had to work a week.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tThat's a long time.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tAbsolutely, I've thought about it since then. Have I ever given my kids a present that was worth a week's wages? No, I haven't.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tMr. Jones, what would have happened if there hadn't been the McCrearys?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tThe McCrearys seemed absolutely inevitable. I never thought about what would happen if they hadn't been there.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWow.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tThey had to be there. I still think we would be in-- let's see, they would be 56, 57 years old now. I've wondered where they're living, how they're doing?\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWhere do you picture them?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tI picture them doing very well. And kind of dull now.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tReally.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tYeah. I don't picture them as being terribly interesting. They're more conservative than their parents. But nice, pleasant, good people.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWhere do you think they're living?\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tI'm afraid I think they're living in Florida.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tThey are, not too far from where you are.\n",
      "@Myron Jones\tI may run into them in the store.\n",
      "@Ira Glass\tMyron and Carol said there was no way their mother would ever hear this story on the radio. And the fact is she never did. The story was first broadcast in 2001. She died at the age of 95 in 2002. After she died, Carol told Myron this secret that she had promised her mother she would never tell him.  It turns out her mom didn't actually buy that baseball glove for Myron. Their uncle bought the glove. And when it arrived at the house wrapped as a gift, Myron's mom intercepted it, gave it to him, and pretended it was from her all along. Carol lives in California. Myron, who was a model of grace and good humor in that interview, died in 2011 at the age of 80. Lovely man.\n",
