    "THURSDAY. SEPTEMBER 29. 1921.\nESCAPING JUICES\nCAUSE MUCH LUSS\nLeaching and Fermentation Dur\ning Ensiling of Corn Is Made\nSubject of Inquiry.\nSILAGE SAMPLES ANALYZED\nEvidence Found of Downwash of\nLiquid in Silo Carrying With It\nSoluble Food Materials\u2014Re\nsults Not Yet Complete.\n^Prepared by the United States Depart\nment of Agriculture.)\nEvery farmer who has a silo knows\nthat some change takes place in the\nsubstance of the corn or other crop\nconserved by this means, and it is\ngenerally assumed that some loss tn\nCutting and Blowing Com Into Silo.\nsubstance of both moist and dry mat\nter takes place as a result of fermen\ntation and leaching. T,o ascertain as\ndefinitely as possible the amount of\nthis loss, its causes, and means for\nwholly or partially preventing it, the\ndairy division of the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture has been\nconducting a series of experiments.\nThe results of two years\u2019 tests are\ncovered in a professional paper, De\npartment Bulletin, 953, Nitrogen and\nOther Losses During the Ensiling of\nCorn.\nSamples of Silage Analyzed.\nSamples of silage in cheesecloth\nsacks were buried at various depths\nand positions In a silo 42 feet high by\n14 feet in diameter, holding approxi\nmately 150 tons. The bags were\nweighed when put in, and samples of\nthe silage analyzed. When the bags\nwere reached in feeding out the silo,\nthe contents were again weighed and\nanalyzed.\nThe two years\u2019 work furnished evi\ndence of a downwash of the juice in\nthe silo carrying with it soluble food\nmaterials, so that the silage in the\nlower part of the silo may gain in\nfood material at the expense of the\nupper part There was an average loss\nfor all the bags of nearly 10 per cent\nof the dry matter, which apparently\nis due largely to the fermentation of\nthe carbohydrates and to the carry\ning away of soluble material by the\njuice. The sugars almost entirely dis\nappeared. There was a considerable\nloss of crude fiber and of the furfurol\nyielding bodies. There was a loss In\ntotal nitrogen, which was larger when\nthe corn put into the silo was im\nmature than when mature corn was\nused. It is probable that this loss Is\ndue largely, If not entirely, to the\nnitrogenous compounds in the juice.\nThe albuminoid nitrogen suffered a\nloss of over 50 per cent, while the\nnon-albumlnoid forms Increased sev\neral times their original weight.\nBig Escape of Juice,\nThere was a gain of ether extract,\nprobably due to the formation of new\nether-soluble bodies. The second sea\nson nearly 10,000 pounds of juice es\ncaped from the silo. This juice car\nried a considerable percentage of\nnitrogen of various forms which in\nordinary practice would remain in the\nsilo.\nThe results are as yet incomplete,\nand the tests are being continued.\nPUREBREDS BEST PRODUCERS\nEnormous Differences Among Dairy\nCows Have Been Brought Out\nin Number of Cases.\nThe value of purebred stock, say\nspecialists in the United States De\npartment of Agriculture, is most no\nticeable in those cases in which the\ncapability of the animals is measured\nmost directly. Among farm animals\nthe best illustration can be found In\ndairy cattle, though careful yearly\ntests of milk and butterfat production\nare relatively recent affairs. The enor\nmous differences among dairy cows\nwhen given the same opportunity have\nbeen brought out clearly in a great\nnumber of cases, and these differences\nare strongly inherited through both\nthe sire and the dam. The average\nproduction for purebreds and grades Is\nmuch above the average of all milk\ncows, which is about 4,000 pounds of\nmilk and 160 pounds of butterfat an\nnually.\n\u201cI Spent $1.25 on Rat-Snap and Saved\nthe Price of a Hog.\u201d\nJames McGuire, famous hog raiser\nof New Jersey, says: \u201cI advise every\nfarmer, troubled with rats, to use\nRT-SNAP. Tried everything to get\nrid of rats. Spent $1.25 on RAT\nSNAP. Figured the rats it killed\nsaved the price of a hog.\u201d RAT-SNAP\ncomes in cake form. No mixing with\nother food. Cats or dogs won\u2019t touch\nit. Three sizes, 85c, 65c, $1.25. Sold\nand guaranteed by Magnussen\u2019s Phar\nmacy and H. F. Adler Hdwe. Co.\nFIND FAULT WITH SEPARATOR\nPays to Investigate When Flow From\nCream Spout Seems Smaller\nThan Ordinarily.\nIf the flow from the cream spout\nof the separator seems smaller than\nordinarily, It usually pays to Investi\ngate. In spite of all precautions, it\noften happens that foreign matter\nlodges in the cream screw\u2019, thus caus\ning part of the cream to be retained\nwith the skim milk.\nDaddys Evening\nCOniiGMT BY VtSTIRN NtWkFU UNION\nTWO BLACK CATS.\n\u201cMe-ow, me-ow, I have some news\nto tell you,\u201d said Bobby Black cat.\n\u201cMeow, me-ow,\nB me-ow, I\u2019d like to\nhear it,\u201d said\nBenny Black Cat.\nThe two cats\nhad been sitting\non a glass roof\nwhich was over a\nbig dining room\nor restaurant\nwhere people ate.\nOften the cats\nw\u2019ould jump down\nand land on some\none\u2019s shoulder or\nupon the tables,\nas the glass roof\nwas opened up in\nthe summer time.\n\u201cOn Some One\u2019s Then, too, the\nShoulder.\u201d cats would walk\nalong the fences\noutside the restaurant and the people\nwould look up at them as they walked.\nSometimes they had games and\nchased each other about and had\nmerry scrambles.\n\u201cWhat is the piece of news you\nhave to tell me?\u201d asked Benny Black\nCat.\n\u201cNow that I think of it,\u201d he added,\n\u201cI have a piece of news to tell you. I\nmust be sure to tell It to you, too, but\nyou tell me your piece of news first.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Benny Black Cat,\n\u201call right, me-ow, me-ow, I will tell\nyou my piece of news first.\u201d\n\u201cContinue,\u201d said Benny Black Cat.\n\u201cI am waiting to hear, for then I w\u2019ill\ntell you my piece of news as I said I\nwould, and by that time the people\nwill be through eating and it will be\ntime for our meal.\u201d\n\u201cYes. and It isn\u2019t right to be late to\nmeals,\u201d said Benny Black Cat. \u201cThat\nis something that isn\u2019t right at all.\nAnd it Isn\u2019t polite.\n\u201cWhen, I see my meal ready for me\nI go right to my meal and never have\nto be called a second time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the same way,\u201d said Benny\nBlack Cat, \u201cI believe in being on time\nto meals.\u201d\n\u201cI heard,\u201d said Bobby Black Cat,\n\u201cthat there was a very bright cousin\nof ours who used to use a door knock\ner every time he wanted to go Into\nthe house where he belonged.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t he have walked straight\nin?\u201d asked Benny Black Cat.\n\u201cOf course, as a rule he could have\ndone so. But then, at times, the door\nwas closed and It was at such times\nthat this cat climbed up and moved\nthe door knocker.\n\u201cWhenever he did this he was let in\nat once, and petted and told what a\nfine cat he was. Isn\u2019t that an inter\nesting piece of news from the Cat\nWorld?\u201d asked Bobby Black Cat.\n\u201cIt most certainly is,\u201d said Benny\nBlack Cat. \u201cI like to hear things like\nthat for it makes folks see how smart\na cat can be, and of course I think\nthey should think that. Don\u2019t you,\nBobby?\u201d\n\u201cI do by all means,\u201d said Bobby.\n\u201cThat was why I was so delighted to\nbe able to tell you this piece of news.\nAnd now, let me hear the piece of\nnews you have to tell me.\u201d\n\u201cI will tell It to you at once,\u201d said\nBenny Black Cat. \u201cI heard the other\nday of some people who kept their\ncity apartment open all summer. And\nthey went away themselves in the\nsummer.\n\u201cThey kept their apartment open\nfor their cat! He was ten years old\nand they loved him so dearly, and yet\nwhere they went in the summer cats\nweren\u2019t much wanted. They went\nboarding, and when folks go boarding\nthey can\u2019t do the same as they would\nin their homes.\n\u201cBut these people kept the apart\nment open for their cat. And the jani\ntor used to give ____________\nhim his food\nevery day, and he\nwould sit in the\nsunny window, rifCf\nwhich was opened f /\nfor him every\nmorning, and en- .A\njoy the bright * \\\nsummer day. \\\n\u201cSometimes he\nwould be taken\nby one of the I\njanitor\u2019s children I y'\nout for an airing, \u2022 -J\nbut he was pretty\nold and he didn\u2019t <\ncare so much .\nabout walking.\nSome cats, of \u201cMoved the Door\ncourse, live to be Knocker.\u201d\nmuch older than\nthat, but this cat was feeling his age.\"\n\u201cWonderful, wonderful,\u201d said Bobby\nBlack Cat \u201cBut what is a janitor?\u201d\n\u201cA janitor is a person who looks\nafter an apartment house and who\ngenerally attends to things.\u201d\n\u201cIncluding the cat,\u201d said Bobby\nBlack Cat \u201cWell, that is fine. Tm\nglad t\u00ae hear of people so devoted to\ntheir cat and of a cat who Is allowed\nto look out of the window or sit in the\nsun or do whatever he pleases. That\nis a fine piece of news, Benny Black\nCat\n\u201cMe-ow, me-ow, that is a fine piece\nof news.\u201d\nHand Don\u2019t Wear Glove.\nWhat hand never wears a glOff*.\nHand of a dock.\nWATCIi US GROW\nFIX FARM INCOME BY\nVOLUME OF BUSINESS\nMust Be Margin Above Annual\nMaintenance Charge.\nSize of Business Is Most Important\nFactor to Be Considered in Select\ning a Place\u2014Three Things\nto Remember.\n(Prepared by the United States Depart\nment of Agriculture.)\nIt requires a farm business of at\nleast fair size to provide an income\nthat will merely cover maintenance\ncharges and these charges are\nrelatively higher for small farms\nthan for large ones, say special\nists of the United States Department\nof Agriculture. A farm may be of\nsuch size as to furnish most living\nneeds of the farmer, such as vege\ntables and fruits, as well as enough in\ncome to pay the taxes and running\nexpenses, but unless there is a mar\ngin above this annual maintenance\ncharge no progress can be made to\nward accumulating a surplus.\nThis point Is often overlooked, and\nthousands of men fail to understand\nwhy they do not get ahead faster,\nwhen, as a matter of fact, the\nsize of their business Is such\nthat there is only a slight pos\nsibility of any margin being left after\nobtaining a bare UvSng and paying\nabsolutely necessary running ex\npenses. Often the Income is insuffi\ncient even to do this, and the farmer\nand his family have to go without\nsome of the comforts of life.\nThus it is that the size of the farm\nbusiness Is one of the most impor\ntant, if not the most Important, factor\nto be considered In selecting a farm.\nIn determining the value of a farm\nIn this regard it is essential, special\nists say, to make sure of three things:\nThat you have an opportunity; that\nis. make sure that the desired volume\nof business Is at least potentially\npresent, as evidenced by tillable land\nor by markets for intensive crops on\nsmall areas.\nThat the volume of business can be\nachieved by economical methods.\nThat the volume of business that\ncan be conducted on the farm is such\nthat it will yield an Income large\nenough to provide a comfortable mar\ngin, after paying the absolutely nec\nessary expenses of operation and pro\nviding an adequate living for the\nfarmer and his family, for saving or\nfuture demands.\nDAIRY COWS LIKE VARIETY\nFew Speckled Apples, Beets, Carrots\nand Other Worthless Foodstuffs\nAre Delicacies.\nA dairy cow appreciates variety in\nher ration almost as much as does a\nThe Circlet is Self-Adjusting, and\nhas neither hooks nor eyes.

Naturally if\none is to keep up the milk flow he\nmust have a cow persistent in her\nmakeup. If she proves otherwise, it\nis probable that she belongs to the\nclass of star boarders that have no\nplace on any dairy farm where busi\nness methods are practiced.\n\u2666 The *\nScrap Book\nFOUND OUT ALL ABOUT IT\nPasser-By\u2019s Curiosity as to the Ac\ntions of Unfortunate Glazier\nShould Have Been Satisfied.\nGlazed and glassy were the glazier\u2019s\neyes.

Jack was made a pet by\nthose on board, and he accumulated\na whole bagful of tricks. One day\nwhen the vessel had headed north\nfrom Barbados, her last port of call,\nJack took offense because one of the\nofficers shooed him out of his room\nwhen the bird interfered with the mak\ning out of a report.\nFor a day Jack brooded, spending\nhis time with the chief engineer.\nEarly the next morning the parrot\nwent to the cages of the other birds\nand liberated at least a score of them.\nThis caused consternation among the\nnegroes of the crew, for parrots kept\npopping out at them from dark places\nand screeching in their ears when not\nexpected. Finally all the birds were\nrecaptured.\nThe officers were responsible for the\nstory that Jack at 11:45 o\u2019clock every\nnight, when the watch was changed,\nwould mount the bridge and shout\nout: \u201cChange watch!\u201d\nMrs. Keach Tells How She Got to\nKnow Rat-Snap.\n\u201cHave always feared rats.

Larger Than Pennsylvania,\nand Contains Most Fertile Soil in\nthe United States.\nI\nThe following from the Moscow i\nGem, a publication by the State\nMutual Co-Operative Insurance j\ncompany, sets forth some of the\nfacts n t generally known outside\nof the state that are highly credit\nable to Idaho.\n\"The very general idea of Idaho\nis that it is one of the smaller\nstates and most of the people are\nsurprised when they learn that it\nranks twelfth in size and is nearly\nas large as Pennsylvania and Ohio\ncombined and is larger than New\nYork and Maine combined and is\nlarger than six New England states\nwith Maryland thrown in lor good\nmeasure. The smallest county in\nthe state is as large as the state of\nRhode Island.\n\"Idaho county, of which Grange\nville is the county scat, is an em\npire. It is about in the center of\nthe state and contains a larger area\nthan the state of Massachusetts.\nThe soil in the farming lands of\nthe northern part of the state is\nsaid, by Professor Mark W. Her\nrington, for many years at the head\nof the weather bureau of the agri\ncultural department, Washington,\nD. C., to be the most fertile soil\nin the United States, perpetually\nfertile. 'In the whole world,' he\nsays, I know of only one locality\nwhich has similar soil. This is in\nChina, and although it has been\ncultivated for 4,000 years, it re\nmains unchanged. One hundred\ntime as many people can be sup\nported by its soil as now live on\nthese lands.\"\n\"In addition to its remarkably:\nfertile farming soil, none of which j\nneeds irrigating, there is in north- i\nern Idaho the largest body of :\nwhite pine left in the United (\nStates, besides the great Coeur \u2022\nd'Alene mining district, which is\nSaid to be the safest, and richest in\nthe world and from which over j\nprofits for\ni\n$20 has been taken in\nevery dollar which has been ex- j\npended in the district, whether :\nfoolishly or otherwise. The Coeur |\nd'Alene district, although corn\n(\nparattvely small and as yet only\nlittle worked, produced in 1907\nover $20,000.000 of mineral wealth\nand paid profits of over $6,000,000.\n\"Idaho has also many sawmills,\none in particular being the largest\n: in the world. It has many beauti\nful lakes and rivers, which are un\ntivailed for beauty and scenery,also\nhunting and fishing and on which\n; several lines of steamers carry\nI , , . , J\npassengers and freight.\nI\nI\n\"Many miles of railroad were\nbuilt, both electric an steam, in\n.\nnorthern Idaho during 1907, there\nby causing many new and prosper\nous towns to spring into exist\nence, while Moscow retains its su\npremacy of being the largest town\nin northern Idaho and the second\ncity as reagrds size in the state of\nIdaho, there are so many good\ntowns and no poor ones, in northern\nIdaho, it would be invidious to\nname any.\n'We believe there are mor e\n'openings in every line of business\nin Idaho than in any other part of\nthe United States,\nIdaho, during the |\nhas seen completed\n\"Southern\nyear of 1907,\nsome irrigation plants which are\nthe wonder of the world and which\nbring many thourand acres of land\nformerly considered almost worth\nless under cultivation. Southern\nIdaho also has a great deal of val\nuable timber, besides some of the\nmost prodcuti ve mines in the world,\nand as regards mining in both the\nnorthern and southern parts of the\nstate, one remarkable fact is that\nthe mines are not owned and con\ntrolled by a few men as they are\nin Butte and Helena, but have been\ndeveloped and ptomoled by a large\nnumber of stockholders in moderate\ncircumstances and to whom\nmonthly the fixed amounts of pro\nfits is distributed.\n\"Sheep raising, irrigated farm\ning, fruit raising, mining and lum\nbering are the gieat industries of\nsouthern Idaho, which has almost\nno end of beautiful, prosperous\nlittle towns oi cities. Piesident\nRoosevelt pronounced Boise to be\nthe most beautiful city in the\nUnited States,\n\"We believe the people of Idaho,\ngenerally speaking, average up\nbetter financially and as regards\nhealth and morals and education\nthan any other state in the Union. \"\nCouncil Votes\nLiquor License\n(Continued from Page One.)\ndered ** F rinted and spread upon\nthe record of the village.\nPermission\nsaid ordinance thereupon the chair\nman signed said ordinance and or\ngiven Joe\nBengoechea to erect a building ac\naccording to plans and specification\nsubmitted to the board by motion of\nRhoades, said building to be on the\ncorner of Atlanta avenue and Ethel\nwas\nstree'.\nIt appearing to f the board that the\nterms as members of the library\nboard of W.

W. Hooker & Co.\nVermont's Largest Housefurnishers\nStudy of Early Fossils.\nThe fossil shells of the early inverte\nbrates are of great importance to geol\nogists, for they indicate the geologic pe\nriod in which the rock beds containing\nthem were formed in other words, the\noge of the rock. Each fosiliferous\nrock bed contains characteristic forms\n,or groups of forms that determine the\nperiod in which it was mud or sand. For\nmer Director Powell of the United States\ngeological survey once tersely explained\nto a congressional committee the value of\npalenotology by saying that it is \"the\ngeologist's clock,\" by which he tells the\ntime in the world's history when any\nrock bed was formed.\nThe economic importance of paleontolo\ngy has been repeatedly shown in this\ncountry. In the earlier exploitation of\nanthracite coal thousands of dollars were\nfruitlessly expended in New York in\nsearch of coal beds until the New York\ngeologist showed tliat the beds in that\nstate could contain no coal. The fossils\nin New York rocks exploited are of De\nvonian age, whereas the fossils of the\nPennsylvanian anthracite coal beds be\nlong to the Carboniferous, a much later\nperiod. This discovery at once stopped\na useless expenditure of money.\nIn times of doubt and perplexity the\ngeologist therefore turns to the paleon\ntologist for light on the age and origi\nnal order of the rock beds he is studying.\nThe study of the animal and plant re\nmains that are embedded in the rocks has\nthus become an important part of geo\nlogic work, and although the specialists\nwho are engaged m this study are few\ntheir. work is of high importance.\nREORGANIZATION DISCUSSED.\nat\nBoston & Maine Affairs Considered\nDirectors' Meetings.\nBoston, May 24.

Aik.,\n\u2022n the years past, was that it\nwas rather a live\nlittle city down in the South Central part of the\nStat* having some\nadvantage over the\naverage\ntown\nof its size because of its rail facilities.\nof\nlate, the district has been somewhat in the lime\nlight on account of phenomenal successes in the\nnewly discovered oil fields, but at that I had never\npicturd El Dorado as being anything more then\nlust one of these \u201cfair to middling\" county seat\ni towns. of which there are many in all parts of\n* the country.\n\"You can, then. imagine my surprise, when on\nthe oepsion of my recent visit, I found myself in\na READ HONEST TO-GODNESS town. one tint\ndeesn t have to doff her sombrero t\nany town.\neven of twice her size, here or anywaere.\nWith a\npopulation now close to 30,000. and a GET-TO\nG ETHER\nand STICK-TOE ETHER\ncivic\nworthy a much larger city, El Dorado is looking\ninto th\" future with unbounded faith and confi\ndelice, and well the may, fo: when cho civiestrue.\nture of any town.\nno\nmatter\nwhat its size, i\nLuilded upon a foundation such as its very appar\nent here, there is nothing in the world outside of\n; unforseen disaster. that can\ncheck\nher\nstendy\ngrowth and advancement.\n\"I have earned the reputation of being some\n: what of a writer and a chronic ronmer\nThe lat\nter I know to be a web arned title.\nJ probably\n, visit more cities around over the l\u2019nited States\n; each year than any other man in the country, and\nI have written up hundreds of these towns for the\n* Nut long ago, at a Dion luncheon, I was\n\u00ab\" d what I considered to l* the must important\nthing in the civic structure ( i a\nide wake town.\nNy answer was emphatic because I happened to be\nfully informed.\nI said:\n'\"SHOW ME A WIDE-AWAKE CIIAMBEI OP\nCOMMERCE AND I WILL SHOW You A WIDE\nAWAKE TOWN.\u2019\n\"I found here a very active Chamber of Com\nmerce in charge of a most efficient secretary, pre\npared to file prompt and reliable information to all\ninquirie s\u2019.\nThe membership of the Chamber of\nCominerce and other civic bodies is made up of\nthhe .active and progressive business men of the\ncity. men who are always on the qui vivo for an\nopportunity to BOOST FOK EL DORADO.\n\"Speaking of that wonderful builder of that\n\u2018Go (letter1 which any town, anywhere, is lucky\nto \u2018.n\u2018 numlerel in its population, did you ever\nleal about the motion of the Booster?\nIt has\nbeen said that when tube Creator had made nil\nthe good things, there still remained some work\nto do. so He made beasts, reptiles and poisonous\ninserts nd when Ho finished there were s mo\nseraps left over.\nHe put all these together, r<\nered them with the garb of suspicic n.\nappol\nthem with jealousy an-l envy and me d. marked\nthe\npt oust with\nresult a KNOCKEI\nv\u2019jiw stecak ent caller th\nThe product was so farful\nto contemplate that Hehad t\u00bb make something to\nrouuterac t it.\nHr took a sunlam. put it into\nthe heart of a child, the brain of\nwise\nwlapped these in eivie pride, ri\nrel them with\nIrtherly love, gave them a\nmask of velvet\nand\na grasp of steel. ami CALLED THE RESULT A\n\u25a0BOOSTED.\u2019\".\nFrom a prospective view-point. El Dorde has\nmany natural advantages more apt to result in\nthe building of a city. tno size and importance of\nwhich may prove a surprise to even the most ardent\n-and optimistic Booster in the community.\nIn other\nediti rials to be published during the 30 weels this\nth osier Campaign will be run. it will be our aim\n.to tko up these many advantages in detail.\nIt\nyou\ny-ai\nare\ninterested in El Dorado, and of course\nare, don\u2019t mlsq a single one of these artieles.\nThe Black Cat Sandwich Shop\nIt was on November 6, 1923 that a\nsurprisin\ng metamorphosis took place in Th\nDorado's business world\u2014a Princess was,\nover night, turned into a Black Cat.\nAnd\nit was all caused by Mr. Joe Robine, who\nat that time bought out the Princess Con\nfectionery, on the southeast corner of the\nsquare, and perversely disregarding\nall\nnatural laws, changed it into the Black Cat\nSandwich Shop.\nAccording to Mr. Robine, however, the\nphenomenon is proving altogether satis\nfactory and is likely to be permanent.\nAir. Robine went into the Sandwich\nShep business more or less as an accident.\nhe says.\nHe came to El Dorado in 1920,\nto take a position in the land department\nof the El Dorado Natural Gas Company,\nand was in the oil game here even before\n. the memorable Busey well came\nin and\nbrought in its wake the bom that has\nmade a town into a city.\nin 1922 he bought the Rialto Sand\nwich Shep, running it as a side line, and\nlast November launched the Black Cat into\nEl Dorado\u2019s commercial sea, selling out\nthe former shop\nsoon afterward.\nOne\nbusiness, Mr. Robine says, is not enough\nto keep him busy, so he divides his time\nbetween brokerage and sandwiches. When\nasked which business he liked the best,\nM . Rcbine replied with fine impartiality\nthat \u201che loved \u2019em both.\u201d\nThe manager of the Biack Cat is Mr.\nG. V. Cockrell. He deserted the automo\nbile business for sandwiches, having been\nemployed for some months prior to the\nbirth of the Black Cat with the Wood\nAnthoy Company.. He sa;\nthat his pres\nent cceupaticn at hast tastes better than\nthe other.\nAnd anyone who has eaten one\nof his hut-ham-on-toast-rye sandwiches\nwill support the statement.\nMr. Cock\nil looks far less dignified\nthan\n1\ntitle would suggest. With white\ncap perched precariously on the back of\nhis head, he was engaged in frying ham\nburgers throughout hi\nintew\n.dew, so the\nlocal color, at least, was perfect.\n\u201cThe sandwich business is all right,\u201d\nbe\nid, between hamburgers.\n\u201cAnd the\nBlack Cat is the all right-est of all.\u201d\n\u2018Like El Dorado?\u201d asked Mr. Cockrell\nn surprise.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m staying here for .\nrood.

To ascertain as\ndefinitely as possible the amount of\nthis loss, its causes, and means for\nwholly or partially preventing it, the\ndairy division of the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture has been\nconducting a series of experiments.\nThe results of two years\u2019 tests are\ncovered in a professional paper. De\npartment Bulletin, 953, Nitrogen and\nOther Losses During the Ensiling of\nCorn. u \u2022 \u25a0\u25a0 - \u25a0\nSamples of Silage Analyzed.\nSamples of silage in cheesecloth\nsacks were burled at various depths\nand positions in a silo 42 feet high by\n14 feet in diameter, holding approxi\nmately 150 tons. The bags were\nweighed when put in, and samples of\nthe Silage analysed. When the bags\nwere reached in feeding out the silo,\nthe contents werp. again, weighed and\nanalysed*;:. f, J,1. ./\nThe twd years\u2019 work furnished evi\ndence of a downwash of the juice lb\nthe silo Carrying with it soluble food\nmaterials, so that the silage In the\nlower part of the silo may gain in\nfood material at the expense of the\nupper part. There was an average loss\nfor all the bags of nearly 10 pier cent\nof the dry matter, which apparently\nIs due largely to the fermentation of\nthe carbohydrates and to the carry\ning away of soluble material by the\njuice. The sugars almost entirely dis\nappeared. There was a considerable\nloss of crude fiber and of the furfurol\nyielding bodies. There was a loss In\ntotal nitrogen, which was larger when\nthe corn put into the silo w-as Im\nmature than when mature corn wa*\nused. It is probable that this loss is\ndue largely, If not entirely, to the\nnitrogenous compounds in the juice.\nThe albuminoid nitrogen suffered a\nloss of over 50 per cent, while the\nnon-albuminold forms Increased sev\neral times their original weight.\nBig Escape of Juice.\nThere was a gain of ether extract,\nprobably due to the formation of new\nethef-Soluble bodies.\" The second sea\nson nearly 10,000 pounds of juice es\ncaped from the sHo: This juice car\nried a considerable percentage of\nnitrogen of \u2019 various fbrms which in\nordinary practice would remain in the\nsilo. \u2019 .\nThe results are as yet Incomplete,\nand the tests are being continued.\nPUREBREDS BEST PRODUCERS\nEnormous Differences Among Dairy\nCows Have Been Brought Out\nin Number of Cases,\nThe value of purebred stock, say\n-ipecialists in the United States De\npartment of Agriculture, is most no\nticeable In those cases in which the\ncapability of the animals is measured\nmost directly. Among farm animals\nthe best illustration can be found in\ndairy cattle, though careful yearly\ntests of milk and butterfat production\nare relatively recent affairs.' The enor\nmous differences among dairy cows\nwhen given the same opportunity have\nbeen brought out clearly in a great\nnumber of cases, and these differences\nare strongly Inherited through both\nthe sire and the dam. The average\nproduction for purebred\u00ae and grades is\nmuch above the average of all milk\ncows,\u2019 which is about 4,000 pounds of\nmilk and 160 pounds of butterfat an\nnually.\nThe Wily Chinese Again.\nThere is a Chinaman in San Jose.\nCal., who believes in grasping oppor\ntunity.

WINDYSPIEL delivered a \nX fine lecture last evening,\u201d said\nMrs. Jamesworthy. \u2018\u2018He held up to\nscorn the pessimist who says the\nworld Isn\u2019t getting better, and de\nscribed conditions as they were a hun\ndred years ago.\nThen people trav\neled on foot or on\nhorseback, and a\nQi?,.-. ::short journey was\na serious matter; \nVL- jEf there were no tel- \n? ephones, no elec-\nB | trie lights, and \nnone of the con\nveniences we are\n||h||U use(l to-\u201d \nis true there\nwere no alleged\nconveniences i n\nt*lose days,\u201d re\nplied James\nworthy, \u201cand for that reason I think\nthe old times were better than the\npresent I only wish the old condi\ntions could be restored. A hundred\nyears ago the married man had no\nreason to dread the poorhouse. It\nwas practically Impossible for women\nto be extravagant then. If they want\ned to blow themselves they had to go\nto town, and in order to get to town\nthey had to ride in old coaches which\nweren't as comfortable as a modern\nhayrack. \n\u201cThe woman of a hundred years ago\ncouldn\u2019t lean back in an easy chair\nand order a hundred dollars\u2019 worth of\njunk by phone. If she ordered by\nletter, it took the letter three weeks\nto get anywhere,and by the time the\ngoods arrived they were out of date,\nand she had to send them back. It\nWould be a great blessing if things\nwere that way now. \n\u201cBut the modern married woman\nhas the softest snap ever invented,\nMrs. James woethy. If she happens to\nbe too lazy to put on her brass-mount\ned harness and go downtown to do her\nshopping, she has that great modern\nconvenience at her elbow. It Isn\u2019t\nnecessary to make herself presentable\nto do her shopping. She sits down\nwith an old wrapper on, and her top\nknot askew\u2019, and her mouth full of\nhairpins, and calls up the butcher and\nbaker and candlestick maker, and or\nders everything they have in their\nJoints, and has it charged to her hus\nband. \n\u201cAs your sway-backed professor\nBald, a short journey was a serious\nbusiness in the old days, and as a re\nsult people stayed home and attended\nto their knitting. If a woman jour\nneyed nine miles in one of the old\ntime coaches she had a backache for\nthree weeks, and so the idea of going '\naway from home didn\u2019t fill her with\nenthusiasm. But nowadays traveling\nis a luxury. All a woman has to do\nis to hold up her husband for the fare,\nand then the urbane railway people\ndo the rest, and make everything so\ncomfortable for her that she hates the\nidea of ever returning home. And be\ncause of this luxury, women are for\never hunting up excuses for a trip\nsomewhere. Kersmlth told me the\nother day that his wife traveled three\nhundred miles and back to match a\nribbon, the local stores not having the\nexact shade she wanted. Kersmlth is\njust about three cubits ahead of the\neherlff, and his wife knows it, but she\nwouldn\u2019t let a small matter like that\ninterfere with her trip. \n\u201cIn the halcyon days people used to\ntallow candles and were all the better\nfor it. There was no satisfaction in\nreading by a candle, so men didn\u2019t\nblow in their substance for fool books\nand magazines. The candles kicked\nup such a smell that they wvre extin\nguished as early as possible, and so\nno money was wasted. Now we have\nthe electric light, which is a great con\nvenience. It is such a thundering con\nvenience, Mrs. Jamesworthy, that it is\ngreasing the road to the poorhouse for\nInnumerable heartsick husbands. The\naverage citizen finds it to\nconvince his wife and daughters and\nother female relatives that the electric\njuice costs money, and so his home Is\nIlluminated from basement to garret\nevery night. Few women remember to\nturn off the light after having It turn\ned on. If I drop dead of heart failure\none of these days, it will be when look\ning over the electric light bill. In the\nold days\u2014\u201d \n\u201cOh, bother the old days, and the\nyoung days, and the middle-aged\ndaysl\u201d cried Mrs. Jamesworthy. \nThat Depends. \n\u201cYou know, my dear fellow, we\nreally gain by our trials In life.\u201d \n\u201cThat depends on the kind of law\nyer you employ.\u201d \nHe Started Early. \nMozart began composing at an ear\nlier age than anybody else on record.\nAt four he was exhibited as an infant\nprodigy, and at five he composed con\ncerto*.

But then, at times, the door\nwas closed and It was at such times\nthat this cat climbed up and moved\nthe door knocker. \n\u201cWhenever lie did this ho was let In\nat once, and petted and told what a\nfine cat he was. Isn\u2019t that an Inter\nesting piece of nows from tiie Cat\nWorld?\u201d asked Bobby Black Cat. \n\u201cIt most certainly is,\u201d said Benny\nBlack Cat. \u201cI like to hear tilings like\nthat for it makes folks see how smart\na cat can be, and of course I think\nthey, should think that. Don\u2019t you,\nBobby?\u201d \n\u201cI do by all means,\u201d said Bohhy.\n\u201cThat was why I was so delighted to\nbe able to tell you this piece of news.\nAnd now, let mo hear the piece of\nnews you have to tell me.\u201d \n\u201cI will tell it to you at once,\" said\nBenny Black Cat. \u201cI heard the other\nday of some people who kept their\ncity apartment open all summer. And\nthey went away themselves in the\nsummer. \n\u201cThey kept their apartment open\nfor their eat I He was ten years old\nand they loved him so dearly, and yet\nwhere they went in the summer eats\nweren\u2019t much wanted.

The work on this\ncut. was under Sub-Contractor Morrisey.\nTrains have been operated around the\ncut for some time past, but the curve on\nthe temporary track was so sharp as to\n.lelay passenger service until therom\nliletion of the cut.\nThe cut is much wider than was orig\ninally contemplated, and a yreat, deal\nmore material had to be moved than\nwas at first estimated. Instead of being\nlargely solid rock it was found on get\nting into the cut that a large part, of the\nmaterial was loose dirt and rock, which\nmade it necessary to acquire more right\nuf-\\\\ay from Dr. Mauzey, not only for\nthe top of the cut, but also for ground\n\u2022in which to place the waste material,\nl or the past month a steam shovel has\nbeen working night and day in the cut.\nSaturday, Sept. 4. the first passenger\ntrain to Usk will pass through the cut.\nThe schedule calls for two trains a day,\nas outlined in The Miner last week. On\nSunday the first excursion from Spo\nkane will be run, connecting with the\nsteamer lone at Usk and from thence to\nlone and return.\nThe new depots at Usk and Dalkena\nare about completed and the first twenty\nmiles to Usk is in first class shape for\nthe opening of the passenger service on\n.Saturday. Section houses and a shelter\nbuilding for the flag station at Wolfred\n:ire also in place.\nTracklaying on the extension will be\nresumed Saturday and Chief Engineer\nSmith estimates that the steel ganfi\nwill reach lone by October 15th. Ma\nterial for the remainder of the work is\npractically all on hand. It is predicted\nthat regular service to lone will be es\ntablished by December Ist.\nFrank Wendt, superintendent of tele\nlegraph and telephone lines for the I. &\nW.N. has a force of men at work string\nWyand tte\nThe New Washing Powder\nGuaranteed to be better than anything\nelse on the Market.\nWe absolutely guarantee to refund the\npurchase price if you are not satisfied\nwith the Goods.\nHome Grocery\nROY WIMBER, Prop.\ning a Commercial telegraph wire.\nAbout fifteen miles of wire has been\nstrung, starting from Rathdrum and\nworking this \\yay\\\nContractor Jas.

The steamer Ruth Drought\nup his outfit from lone.\nThe Great Northern had an extra\ngang in town AVednesday, making some\nrepairs on the east end of the depot\nplatform. This does not look much like\nthe building of a new depot this fall. It\nis intimated that there is some question\nas to the ability of the State Railroad\nCommission to enforce its various orders\nfor improvements. Also that the O. R.\nit N. practically told the commission to\ntake a jump into the lake and that they\nwould suit themselves as to obeying its\norders. The building of a new depot\nand betterment of facilities for handling\nfreight at this point would certainly be\na business advantage to the Great North\nern, but it moves slowly, as do all great\nbodies.\nA freight wreck on the Great North\nern delayed through trains about eight\nhours on Sunday.\nHave Difficuly in Holding Teachers\nThe local school board early this\nsummer selected their corps of teachers\nfor the coming year and.supposed that\ntheir troubles were over. Since that\ntime numerous resignations have been\nhanded in and the board has had to se\nlect several new teachers. School w?ill\nopen next Monday and at this time\nthere are two vacancies on the list of\nteachers,possibly three. Notification of\ntheir election has been wired to two\nteachers but acceptance has not yet\nbeen received. The members of the\nboard feel that another resignation\nwould make them feel like resigning\nand hope that they will be able to keep\na string on those now lined up.\nSchool on the Idaho side will also be\ngin next Monday. The Idaho school\nwill have three teachers this year.\nMrs. J. W. Javsinger and daughter\nMabel, who have been visiting with her\nbrother, W. E. Boger, have left for Se\nattle and other western points before\nreturning to their home in Ohio.\nTry a Sack\nOnly 25 Cents\nNEWPORT, WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1909\nALLOTTING LANDS TO INDIANS\nGlair Hunt Will Parcel Out\nValuable Lands\nGovt. Refused to Move Them\nClair Hunt, former clerk of the super\nior court of this county, who has for\nsome time been engaged in the work of\nmaking allotments to the Indians on the\nSpokane and Colville Indian reserva\ntions, left this noon for Cusick, to start\nthe work of making allotments of the\nIndian lands across the river from that\npoint.\nMr. Hunt will have a crew of several\nmen to assist him in the work, and took\ndown today a\\ lot of supplies and camp\nequipage. He states that the work will\ntake about six weeks to complete.\nThe allotting of the lands to the In\ndians is the result, of a petition circu\nlated last winter, asking the interior de\npartment to remove the Indians to some\nreservation, alleging that they consti\ntute a menace to the health ot white\nresidents of the valley. Also that they\nshould haye school facilities and be\nproperly cared for by the government.\nThe department sent an agent to inves\ntigate the conditions, and he found that\nthey were very much opposed to giving\nup their homes in thevalley. It was\ntherefore decided to make allotments of\nlands to them and provide schools.\nThere is an Indian population in that\nvicinity of about 80. Not all of them are\nentitled to the full 160-acre allotments,\nand it is reported that since the news\nthat an allotment would be made has\ngotten out a number of Indians from\nother points have come into the valley\nwith the idea of getting in on the distri\nbution.\nAt any rate there are enough Indians\nwho have rights to take up about all the\nland they are now holding. These lands\nare classed among the best in the valley\nand it would have been far better for\nboth the Indians and the white resi\ndence had the government taken the red\nmen to some distant agency and opened\nthe land for white settlement, and de\nvelopment.\nHill Opens Speed War\nChicago, Aug. 31.\u2014The railroad run\nning time from Chicago to Seattle will\nbe reduced to 62 hours\u201410 hours below\nthe present schedule\u2014as the first move\nin a war declared upon all other western\nand northwestern roads by James J.\nHill of the Great Northern, according\nto a story which the Record-Herald will\nprint tomorrow.\nThe Burlington, Great Northern and\nNorthern Pacific have made a propo\nsition to the postofFice department to\nput a new fast mail train in service be\ntween Chicago and Seattle to make the\nlong ruu in 62 hours. If the govern\nment accepts the proposition it will re\nsult in facilitating the northwest mail\nservice by lully half a day. It is pro\nposed to start the new fast train out of\nChicago about I:su a. m. It is to ar\nrive at Seattle at noon of the third day.\nWill Run a Tunnel\nA contract for 150 feet of tunnel work\nhas just been let by the Bead Lake Min\ning Co., located in the Newport mining\ndistrict and about two miles from the\nConquest landing on the Pend Oreille\nriver. This property has been devel\noped by about 2600 feet of tunnel work\nand large bodies of high-grade ore have\nbeen found.\n*\nThere are three distinct ledges on the\nproperty, which crop out at the edge of\nthe river, and two of these have been\ntapped on the property exactly accord\ning to the survey. Measurements show\nthat the main tunnel, where the contract\nwork will be done, will tap the third\nledge within 130 feet and at a depth of\n950 feet. The mi.ne is well equipped\nwith necessary machinery and the man\nagement expects to put the mine on a\npaying basis in a short time.\nGot Colville Going Some\nThe registration books for the town of\nColville closed with a total registration\nof 306. Newport. Washington, with a\nconsiderable part of the town outside\nthe corporate limits registered 254.\nAdd to our registration the voters re\nsiding on the Idaho side of town, who\nnumber close to 100, and it is plainly\nevident that Newport, Washington and\nIdaho, have the countj'seat town going\ni some iti the matter of population.\nSatisfaction or Money Back\nWe are selling hoisery that must satisfy you and everyone in\nyour family.

At\nnight the fire presented a beautiful but\nawe-inspiring sight as it climbed the\nmountains. Today the fire is practic\nally under control and no further spread\nis anticipated.\nIt started in section 21, township 56,\nrange 5, about a mile east of Albeni\nFalls, and has burned over parts of 21,\n16, 15 and 22. It covered a strip about\nthree miles long and a mile to a mile\nand a half wide, running north and\nwest.\nThe Pend Oreille Lumbermen's Pro\ntective Association, assisted by the state\nfire warden, has had. a force of men at\nwork fighting the flames. The state\ndeputy fire warden, residing at Spirit\nLake, returned to his home today, and\nreports that the fire is under control and\nhas done but very little damage. It is\nconfined entirely to yellow pine timber,\nand as there is Very little brush the\ntimber is not hurt to any extent.\nThe Fidelity Lumber Co. had a force\nof men at work Tuesday backfiring to\nkeep the fire from running through their\nholdings and endangering their plant.\nThe fire was stopped at a point about\ntwo miles from the mill.\nThe big Granite creek fire in the Kan\niksu National Forest continues to rage\nand is causing considerable anxiety. It\nhas covered a large strip of territory,\nbut fortunately a large percentage of it\nhad been burned over previously. For\nest Supervisor Millar is on the ground\nwith a force of over 100 men. This fire\nhas been burning over three weeks, and\nperhaps the only thing that will stop it\nis a heavy rainfall.\nThe Association of Fourth Class Post\nmasters of Stevens County will meet at\nthe Fair at Colville on Wednesday, Sep\ntember, 15. The object of this organi\nzation is to improve conditions in the\npostal service from an exchange of ideas\nand experiences.\nRiver Notes\nThe steamer Newport makes its last\ntrip on the Blueslide-Newport run to\nday. The Spokane and lone will be ueed\nonthe lone-Usk run, each making a\nround trip daily to connect with the\npassenger trains, while the Newport\nwill be tied up at Usk and used as a\nsteamboat jffice until the completion of\nthe railroad to lone, when it is likely\nthat the boat service will be practically\ndiscontinued.\nThis will leave the steamer Ruth the\nonly boat on the through run from New\nport to lone. The Ruth is enjoying a\ngrowing business and will soon be mak\ning the through run to Metaline.\nAs the railroad progresses down the\nvalley the transfer of passengers and\nfreight to the boats will go down with\nit, as it is conceded that the boats will\nhave difficulty in making the round trip\nschedule from Usk to lone after the\nwater gets lower.\nCitizens of Cusick are talking of buld\ning a public dock for the use of all boats.\nThe fact that the railroad does not con\ntemplate, at least at present, the estab\nlishing of a station at their town makes\nthe citizens desirous of keeping up boat\ntransportation.\nThe steamer Metaline is now making\nconnections at lone with the boats of\nthe Pend Oreille River Navigation Co.\nThe Metaline made the first trip through\nBox Canyon on Wednesday, coming\nthrough from Elk Landfng to the head\nof the canyon in eight minutes. Capt.\nFlanders is well pleased with the be\nhavior of his boat in making the trip,\nand anticipates no difficulty in making\nconnections.\nA report is current at Sandpoint that\nseveral of the steamboats of the Pind\nOrielle River Navigation Co. will be\nknocked down and shipped to Pend\nOreille Lake, where they will be placed\nin service hauling ore to the smelter and\ndoing a general pas3enger and freight\nbusiness. It is a certainty that with\nthe completion of the Idaho & Wash\nington Nortnern Metaline extension\nthere will not be business enough on the\nriver to warrant retaining all the boats\nnow in commission.\nCapt. Napoleon LeClerc, the veteran\nsteamboat man, left this noon for a trip\nto the Kootenai lake country in British\nColumbia, to look over the steamboating\nbusiness in that section.\nWin a Cash Prize\nMother and father and Tillie\nand Sam,\nAs well as big sister Ann,\nHave proven by test,\nThat Black Cats are best\u2014\nBuy them as soon as you can.\nAn admirer of the Black Cat\nstockings wrote the above rhyme.\nThe Black Cat thought the idea\nwas so good that he also wrote\nsome verse.

This Is doubt\nless due to the animal's weird looking\neyes, its peculiar habits, stealthy move\nment's, night prowling and its strange,\nvocal accomplishments, ranging from\nsoft, musical \"mewing'* to the \"walling\nshriek\" described by Poe, \"half of hor\nror and half of triumph; such as might\nhave arisen only out of hell, conjointly\nfrom the throats of the damned In their\nagony, and of the demons that exult lu\nthe damnation.\"\nUpon this atmosphere of mystery which\nattaches to the cat and the widespread\nbelief that the animal exercises a mys\nterious influence over the lives and des\ntinies of human beings, the poet Poe 1\nfounded his grewsome tale, \"The Black\nCat.\" These cuiflous beliefs and super\nstitions attaching to the cat existed in\nvery early times. In ancient Egypt the\ncat was sacred to tne Goddess Isis and\nwas held in the highest reverence. Tem\nping were erected In its honor and sac\nrifices and devotions offered up to it. !\nWhen the family cat of an Egyptian t\nfamily died, the members of the house- |\nhold were required to shave off their ;\neyebrows. And in the city of Cairo there '\nwas within very recent years an insti\ntution for the care of destitute cats.\nWhen the Middle Ages are reached it\nis found that old Father Time has trans\nmuted the Egyptian veneration for the\ncat into something quite the opposite. By\nthis time cats had come to be regarded\nas the familiars of witches. The favorite |\nshape of Satan was said to be that of a j\nblack cat and the animal was an object j\nof dread, instead of veneration. Their\nsuperstitious connection with witches and\nthe foolish belief that a cat has nine lives ;\nhave led to the perpetration of great cru\nelties upon these harmless and useful do\nmestic animals.\nThere is still current In America and in\nthese days of education and enlighten\nment, a great mass of folk-lore and curi\nous beliefs about cats. Many of these\nhave been collected by the American\nFolk-Lore society. The multiplicity of\nthese \"'human documents\" shows that en\nlightenment and education naver have\nbeen able to run fast enough to escape\nfrom the company of the black cat.\nIn eastern Kansas is found somewhat\nprevalent the belief that if one kills a\nblack cat some member of the household\nwill die soon.\nIn New England and eastern Kansas\nit is an omen of good fortune to be fol\nlowed by a black cat. But to be followed\nby a black cat at night is unlucky in Cape\nBreton and New Hampshire. In the last\nnamed localities it also is unlucky if a\nblack cat come to one\u2019s house, while in\neastern Massachusetts and Pennsylvania\nit is an omen of good luck.\nIn Mussachusetts it \"brings good luck\"\nto throw a dead black cat over the left\nshoulder and turn around twice.\nIn Alabama the spirit of an old maid\nafter death takes possession of some\nblack cat. In the same state to cut off\nthe end of a black cat\u2019s tail and bury it\nunder the doorstep is to keep sickness\nout of the family.\nThe belief that it is bad luck to kill a\ncat Is general, and in Pennsylvania and\nlow'a is found the superstition that if a\nfarmer kill a cat some of his stock will\ndie.\nThe black cat also makes \"good medi\ncine.\" Here are some specimens of \"cat\ncure\" lore:\nThe blood of a black cat will cure a\nspavined horse.\nBlood from the tip of the tail of a black\ncat without a single white hair will cure\na sty.\nApply the freshly removed skin of a\ncat as a remedy for shingles.\nThe heart of a black cat, applied as\nsoon as killed, will stop bleeding from\na wound.\nThe skin of a black cat worn in one\u2019s\nclothing will cure rheumatism.\nHere are a few specimens of the omens\nwhich are associated with the feline:\nIf you dream of a cat it signifies that\nyou have an enemy.\nIn Canada, Michigan and Eastern Kan\nsas a cat of three colors brings luck\nand in the last named place is regard\ned as a protection against fires.\nA \"smutty\" nosed cat brings wealth\nto its owner.\n\u201cUp in Maine\u201d it means poverty to\nown a white cat. *\nIf a cat runs across your path you\nwill be disappointed if you do not im\nmediately turn back.\nThe possession of a black cat or a\nblack and white one brings sickness to\nthe family.\nA spotted cat coming to your house is\na lucky omen.\nA double-pawed cat floretells good\nluck.\nThat you will break friendship with\na person to whom you give a cat is be\nlieved in New England.\nIn Ohio if a neighbor's cat comes lis\ntening around Your home it means news\ncarrying, and you may know that the\nneighbors are gossiping about you.\nIn Massachusetts a cat putting its paw\nover its head means company. And when\nthe cat licks its paws that also means\ncompany, and the company will come\nfrom the direction, to which its tail points.\nIn Labrador it means visitors when the\ncat scratches the door post.\nWhen the cat washes its face it is a\nsign of visitors in Massachusetts, New\nYork, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\nIn Eastern Kansas it is a favorable\nomen when the cat sits before the fire\nand washes its face.\nAfter washing its face visitors will\ncome from the direction, in which the cat\nlooks.\nIf a cat washes its face In the presence\nof several persons the first it looks at will\nbe the first to get married and will be the\nfirst of those present, to die.\nIf a cast washing its face before a gre.\npauses in its ablutions and looks directly\nat anyone, that one will receive a letter,\nir. a Kansas belief, as also is the super\nstition that If the cat follow one who is\nleaving home, it presages harm. Also,\nthat It Is unluqky to move into a house\nwhere formfer occupants have left their\ncats and dogs.\nIn some localities it Is bad luck not to\nmove the cat when the family moves; In\nother localities it is an ill omen to move\nthe cat.\nThe cat also runs a weather bureau;\nA cat \u201cbawling\" Is a sign of rain in\nNewfoundland.\nA cat eating grass indicates rain In\nMaine, Michigan and Massachusetts.\nIf a cat's fur shines and looks glossy\nnext day will be pleasant.\nIn Alabama a cat washing its face\nmeans rain. In New England this state\nment is limited to ablutions on, the part\nof the cat before breakfast or in the\nparlor.\nThe direction from which the cat's paw\nmoves In washing indicates direction from\nwhich the storm will come.\nIn central Maine It will storm soon It.\nyou see the cat looking out of a window.\nIn Kansas it means a change of weather\nwhen the cat plays and frisks about in\nthe house. And in New York a storm is\nlooked for when an old cat frisks through\nthe house at night.\nWhen a eat is sharpening its claws the\nway its tail points indicates the direction\nof the wind next day, is a Maine super\nstition.\nWhen the cat turns Its back to the\nstove it means cold weather.\nIf the eat lies with the back of its head\nturned downwards, it means a storm.\nWhen the cat holds its nose up in the air\nIt signifies rain.\nThat putting a coal hlack cat under a\nbushel measure when it is raining will\nmake the rain stop, is a belief enter\ntained in Maryland.\nIt is a general belief that a cat never\nshould be left alone with a sleeping child,\nas tlie cat may \u201csuck the child's breath,'*\nIn Ohio is found the belief that playing\nwith a cat* will make a child stupid.\nThe following was found within the\nshadow of the State University at Law\nrence, Kansas: \u201cNever take a cat near\na dead person, lest the cat take the sold\nof the dead.\"\nThe cat and dog are hereditary enemies\nbecause the cat once stole the right of\nthe dog.\nGrease a cat's foot and it will stay at\nyour house.\nThe belief is general that cats can't\nsmell when their whiskers are cut off.\nIn New England it Is regarded as un\nsafe to have a cat in the room during a\nthunderstorm.\nIn Maine it Is believed that in the tip\nof every cat\u2019s tail are three hairs of the\ndevil\u2014which accounts for the cat's dis\nposition to prowl.\nA Notable Performance.\nFrom Harper\u2019s Weekly.\nA member of the school board of\nPhiladelphia describes a unique school\nhouse in northern Pennsylvania, where\ntue schoolmaster keeps his boys grind\ning steadily at their desks, but some\ntimes permits them to nibble from\ntheir lunch boxes as they work.\nOne day the pedagogue was instruct\ning a class in arithmetic, when he no\nticed tnat one pupil was devoting more\nattention to a piece of pie than to his\nlesson. \"\n\u201cWilliam,\u201d commanded the stern\nmentor, \u201cwill you pay attention to the\nlesson?\u201d\n\"I\u2019m listening, sir,\u201d said the boy.\n\"Listening, are you?\u201d exclaimed the\nmaster. \u201cTnen you\u2019re listening with\none ear and eating pie with the\nother!\u201d\nPep-To-Lac\u2014Rests and assists the\ntired and overworked stomach.

Hopkins,\nCopyilRhteiJ. 1808, by Robert Bonner's Sons.\nw\nCHAPTER II.\nHaving gone thus far, Rob would not\nhave been a true boy had ho not look\ned forward to this great change In hl3\nlife without more or less eagerness and\npleasure. And Rob was a true boy. He\nwas a good boy, and a good scholar.\nHe was the best runner, the best loot\nball player, and the best swimmer In\nthe circle of boys in which ho was\nleader. The blood of splendid health\ncourserl through his veins. Ho was\nsturdy, strong and handsome. What\nboy Bucii as thi3 would not hall with\ndelight a life in South America, with\nprospects of adventures in wild and\nmysterious places.\nMrs. Cleverdale so far entered Into\nhis hopes and plaii3, that at last she\nbecame not only reconciled to the part\ning, but pleased at it. It meant so\nmuch for the boy Bhe dearly loved. She\nbelieved that her own life would not\nbe long, and she was glad of this op\nportunity for Rob to find a home where\nI1I3 future was assured.\nAnd at last the eventful day came\nMrs. Cleverdale had a friend, a lawyer.\nwho undertook to get Rob safely off,\n\"He goes to Rio de Janeiro on the\nUnited States and Brazil mail,\" said\nthe lawyer, Mr. Drown. \"At Rio he\nchancres and takes another shin. For\ntunately, I am acquainted with the cap\ntain of the 'Vlgilancla,' which sail3\nnext week from here. I will take Rob\nto ecc him, and then we can rest as\n6ured that he will arrive safely. There\nS3 no better sailor or better man afloat\nthan Captain Dakcr of the 'Vigilan\nda.' \"\nSo Mr. Brown took Rob to meet Cap\ntain Baker. The captain of tho VIgl\nIancia was a line, nearly man, every\ninch a sailor, and every inch a gentle\nman. He won the boy '3 heart at once\nby his klndnes3.\n\"Don't you worry about this young\ngentleman, Mr. Brown,\" he said. \"He\nand I arc going to be very good frlend3.\nA western lady.who formerly llvod at\nCambridOT, Mass., writes entertaining\nly of what she declares wa3 tho hap\npiest Christmas of her life. The climax\nof this merry occasion was a house\nparty given at the home of her uncle\nnot many miles from Cambridge. The\nlady writes:\n\"My uncle owned a big place about\ntwenty miles from town, and every\nyear he InvlteJ all his relatives to\nepend tfio Christmas holidays with\nhim. He was a widower with two chil\ndren a son 23 years old and a daugh\nter cf 17. This girl, my cousin, Stella,\nwas one of the brightest and most\nfun-loving girls I have ever known. I\nwas Just two years her senior, and be\ntween us we managed to ctir up that\nhouse party to a degree nothing short\nof startling! Twenty people beside\nour family were invited, there being\naltogether about thirty guests In the\nhouse. Among them were a young law\nyer from New York (for whom I im\nmediately conceived a violent admira\ntion), a naval officer, three Yale men\nfrom New Haven, my two brothers, an\nantique female cousin of ours (age un\nknown), Borne girls from New York\nand a young married couple from St.\nLouis. Beforo the end of r week Stel\nla and I h3d almost originated a di\nvorce case, where the young St. Louis\ncouple were concerned. Of course,\nthere were some other people, but they\nwere sort of chaperones, old fogies who\ndidn't count much. Well, that year\nthe 25th of December fell cn Wednes\nday, and the guests were invited from\nDec. 23 to Jan. 2, and I can tell you\nwe made Rome howl. My brothers\nnd I, with our parents, arrived at our\nuncle's lata Monday morning. The\nenow had been falling steadily for\nthlrty-slx hours, and was many Inches\ndei?.\n\"We drove from the little rickety\nltlcm three miles 'cross country to\nthe farm. We were the first arrivals\nanJ wo made good use of iho advan\ntage over the other Invited guests. The\nnext train, at 4 o'clock, brought them\nAll, and at 5 they came shouting and\nsinging cp to the house, an sieigns\nwaaons and carriages, borrowed from\nthe farmers all over that part cf the\ncountry. Well, the first evening was\nnatzoA in h hi? dining room, all of\nus crowded about the roaiing log fire\nThat Is, nil of us, excepting the young\nlawyer from New York and myself,\nWe were seated on a chintz-covered\neaap-box, eff in a dim corner of the\nroom, discussing er the possibilities\nof effect of \"mistletoe on ah mankind.\nDefore the candles were brought In to\nannounce the 'time for disappearing,'\nwe two \"had begun to understand each\nether. It was our first meeting, but la\nlh country, and at Christmastlde, peo\nple bpcome acquainted very quickly.\nThe next morning we all arose at 8\no'clock, and after the jollicst kind of a\nbreakfast, we hauld In great bunches\ncf evergreen, reels of crow-foot moss,\nand pile after pile of holly and mistle\ntoe. We spent mtst of the day on slep\nladders cr tallies, hammering and tack-\nnc the Christmas decorations In place.\nAnd in the evening my uncle had a big\npino tree brought in and set up In the\npatlov. We had each brought scores\nof little packages from town to present\ncn Christmas morning, and theso\nwere suspended frm the branches of\nthe tree. Mistletoe was everywhere,\nand so were the girls. The conse\nquence will bo readily understood the\nmen were not of the variety known as\nshy.\n'It wal leng past midnight when we\ntrooped o:f to cir rooms and 2 o'clock\nstruck before th last good night rang\ndown the darkened hallway. As soon\nas all was quiet, I stole from my room,\nand tlp-toert down the corridor to my\ncousin Stella's door. It was locked.\nsignal for a grand rush to the parlor,\nAnd lo! the big Chrlotmas tree had\nflown. My unci? was enraged, the\nguests much excited, and the young\nlawyer from New York looked very\nmuch amused. A search was prompt\nly instituted, and of course the tree\nwes faur.d in the library, standing In\nstately solitude.\n\"Who on earth could have put\nthr-ri? Ko one knew and no one\ncould guess Stella and I were partleu\nl.irlv nhtuse. And after awhile tho\nprtsents were distributed. The youn\nmarried weman's card war. inclosed in\na bundle ef cmbroldtrcd flannel petti\ncoats to 'ray darling husband and\n'darling husband' presented his 'little\nlove' with a volume of Mother Goose\ntalts, and a red balling suit; my old\nmaid cousin received a Dutch pipe and\na pair of hunting trousers; my uncle\ngot a half dozen tulle veils and a pair\nof gold garter clasps.\"\nuel Starne, and ho was apparently of\nmixed English and Spanish parentage.\nHo was quite handsome and well dress\ned, with black, piercing eyes, and a\nfirm look about tho mouth. Rob was\nglad to bo friends with Mr. Starne, for\ntho sail to Buenos Ayres would have\nbeen a long and lonely one without a\nfriend to talk to. Tho captain of the\n\"Royal Mall\" was not bo friendly aa\nCaptain Baker, and Rob fell in with\nMr. Starne most of the time.\nMr. Starne was much Interested in\nRob's prospects, and his coai-Diacit\neyes glistened when Rob, in tho Inno\ncence of his heart, told what a splendid\noffer Mr. Horton had mudo him. But\nMr. Starne, while getting all Robs\nstoir out of him, said nothing about\nhis own business on board tho \"Royal\nMail.\"\nThe ship stopped at Montevideo, in\nUraguay, and then entered the River\nde La Blata.\nIt was on a black and moonless night\nwhen Rob and Mr. Starne were stand\ning near the rail chatting. The few\npassengers were distributed far away\nfrom them, and tho crew were busy.\nThere was no one near enough to see\nin the darkness, just what was going\non in that portion of tho deck.\nMr. Starno was bending over the rail.\n\"Lock down there.\" he said to Rob.\n\"Seo that splendid phosphorescent\nlight.\"\nRob leaned far over the rail and\npeered downward.\nSuddenly he felt a clutch from bo\nhind. A hand was clapped over his\nmouth, and, without being able to cry\nout or to make a struggle for his life,\nRob was shoved over the rail, and went\ndown like a log into the foaming wa\nters that churned around the speeding\nsteamer.\nCHAPTER HI.\nThe Rescue on Board the Black Cat.\nThe steamship of the Royal Mall was\nI IrV,\nRECEIVED A TAIR OF HUNTING\nTROUSERS,\nbut I tapped gently, and was soon ad\nmitted. We two girls slipped down\nstairs, where I had told the butler (an\nold servant of my uncle's) to wait for\nus. And there we put our three heads\ntogether and concocted a grand\nscheme, for the undoing of everybody\nIn the house. We tugged and hauled\nthat Mg over-loaded Christmas tree\nfrom the parlor, through the hall Into\nthe library, and then we exchanged\nthe names on all the presents. It was\nalmost daylight before we finished, but\nwo were amply repaid for our trouble.\n\"By 9 o'clock everybody was dressed\nand down stairs, exchanging greetings\nand gifts. Stella and I were the last\nto arrive, and cur entrance wa the\nTHOSE CHRISTMAS CHILDREN.\nThe little folks at our house they talk\nlike anything\n'Bout Santa Claus comln', an what he's\ngoln' to bring;\nAn' mother never has to scold, or tell\n'em 'bout the noise\nThey're Just the sweetest little girls\nthe best of little boy!\n'Cause why?

Every scrap of ribbon, the\ntiniest card, the very scrap3 of bright\nwrapping paper, are all hoarded, and\nus2d somewhere for decoration. The\nlittle girl makes sashes of the ribbons\nand dresses for her paper dolls of the\ntissue wrappings, while the cards serve\nas priceless works of art on the vails\nof her playhouse.\n.The lucky man Is the man whtf sees\ntnd graipj his opportunity.\niTrCZ?-&, .vTr'.rr-I i I I ''Hi.

He's all right. We\nEall on Wednesday. Don't forget.\"\nSo on Wednesday Rob found him\nself on board tho \"Vlgllancia\" with hl3\nmother and Mr. Brown to sec him off.\nMrs. Cleverdale could not help crying\na little, but she laughed gayly imme\ndiately after, and the memory that Rob\ntook away with him was his mother\nand Mr. Brown laughing away as If\nthey enjoyed the occasion. This helped\nRob very much.\nOn Wednesday the big ship left her\ndock and steamed away.\nIt was in the winter time, and Rob,\nclosely muffled in a big ulster, stood on\nthe deck watching tho sights as they\nwent down the East river, and down\nthe bay. After the panorama of the\npassing docks he became Interested In\nIhe grand view of the harbor, the Sta\ntue of Liberty, which looks so differ\nent when viewed from tho city; the\nforts, with their ugly looking guns, the\ntaking on of a pilot and his departure\nall these things kept Rob interested,\nbo that even when he thought he was\nleaving his native land, perhaps for\never, ho waved aside the Borrow, and\ntold himself that soon he would bo a\nman with money enough to come back\nif ho wished.\nCaptain Baker was very kind to Rob,\nand, with the exception of a few days\nof seasickness, the boy enjoyed the trip\nto Rio de Janeiro a distance of nearly\nseven thousand miles very much.\nAt Rio, Captain Baker Introduced\nhim to the captain of a ship of the\nRoyal Mail Line, which was to go to\nBuenos Ayres. This was the final step\nof Rob's long Journey, and it was here\nthat his troubles were to commence\nThere were few passengers on board,\nand most of these were natives of Bra\nzil or the Argentine Republic, travel\ning on business. There was one paa\nsenger, however, who seemed to take a\ngreat fancy to Rob, and who at onco\nstruck up an acquaintance with him.\nThis was a young man about twenty-\nflre years of age. His name was Lem\nnot the only thing afloat in La Plata\nRiver that dark night. Hidden from\nthe men on the swift steamer by the\nthick blackness of the night, and the\nfact that she carried no lights, was a\nschooner, which was feeling her way\nacross the broad expanse of tho estu\nary, within hailing distance of tho\nsteamship that passed her unwittingly.\nThis schooner was a peculiar craft.\nShe was not bo peculiar in appearance\nas in action. She was a low, narrow\ncraft, built for epeed, and carried a\ntremendous amount of sail. As has\nbeen said, there wa3 no light shown on\nthe schooner. She ran tho risk of be\ning struck by a passing vessel. But thl3\nwas only a chance, and her captain\nknew that if Hght3 were shown there\nwas almost a certainty of being run\ndown by government boats.\nAcross the stern of this vessel no\nname fould be peen in the brightest\ndaylight. But still she had a name, it ,\nwas \"El Gato Negro,\" or \"The Black\nCat.\"\nThe crew of \"El Gato Negro\" was a\nmixed lot of rascals, some being Span\nish, born in South America, some being\nFrench, some Portuguese, and some na\ntive Indian. \"The Black Cat\" had a\nbad name among the officials of Ar\ngentina, and she was, In reality, the\nfastest and most successful smuggler\nin the world.\nShe was entering the river, even now,\nwith a cargo of rifles and ammunition,\nand also of rum and tobacco, on which\nthere is a heavy duty in Argentina, and\nwas making in the dark for a certain\nspot where the contraband cargo could\nbe landed without fear of detection.\nTho language spoken on board the\n\"Black Cat\" was . something beyond\nprinted words to describe. It was cer\ntainly a Jargon of English, mixed with\nSpanish, French or any other lan\nguage that came handy. The men were,\nto a man, a desperate, cut-throat gang.\nCaptain Torrevo. of the \"Black Cat\"\nwas on deck peering at the lights of the\nsteamer, which was passing a short\ndistance ahead of tho schooner. He\ngrinned with satisfaction as he thought\nhow lucky it was for him that the\nnight was too black for the men on th\nsteamer to see the \"Black Cat\"\nTho captain had taken extra precau\ntion to avoid a collision of any kind,\nand a half dozen lookouts were dis\ntributed throughout the schooner. With\nbut half her Balls spread to tho gent!\nnight breeze, tho \"Black Cat\" glided\neasily and noiselessly through tio\nwater.\nTho Royal Mall was now Ik tip the\nriver, and her lights could Just be dis\ntinguished; they flickered, then wero\ngone. Tho \"Black Cat\" was crossing\nthe path of the steamer, not more than\nthree minutes after she had passed.\n\"Hist!\" camo a cry from a lookout\nIn the bow. \"Me hear cry cry see?\nListen!\"\n\"Ho! Me hear urn!\" said another\nlookout who had strained\" hla eura.\n\"What um be? Man in water Y\n\"Him over there!\" shouted a fellow\nwho was as black as the night Itself.\n\"Hark! Hear de samo zing over?\"\nCaptain Torrevo had rushed forward,\nand was listening intently.\nFaintly there camo to his ears tho\nwords, \"Help! I am drowning! Help!\"\n\"Boy In the water,\" said the captain,\nwhose ears never deceived him on tho\nwater. \"Hey! Port there! Hard!;\nStand by there to rescue! Lower away,\na boat!\"\nMen sprang to obey the captain, and\nin an Instant there was a small boat\nresting on the water, with four\nswarthy and almost murderous looking\nmen in it for what? To rescuo a hu\nman being from drowning. Theso mea\nwould take tho lifo of another as quick\nly as look at him if his lifo was neces\nsary to their own safety. But the cry\nfor help that came from tho black wa\nter of the river had found a response\nin their own hearts, as it might havo\nfound in tho hearts of the manliest and\nmost courageous of the sallor3 on a\nman-of-war.\nWhen Rob struck the water, after\nhi3 sudden plungo from the deck of th\n\"Royal Mall,\" he went down deep into\nthe river, and for a moment wa3 bereft\nof his senses. But this was eimply for\nthe moment, and up ho camo again to\ntho surface, to battle bravely for his\nlife. He saw the receding lights of tho\nsteamer, and cried out aa lustily as ha\ncould for help. But the steamer had\ngone too far for his voice to bo heard\non board, and it was heard instead by\nthe men on the \"Black Cat.\"\nSuddenly Rob, who was not trying to\nswim, but simply to keep hlm3elf\nafloat, which he was able to do, heard\nthe plash of oars near him. Then he\nheard tho voice of a man calling out to\nhim: ;\n\" 'Hoy! 'Hoy! Where him be?\" ;\n\"Here I am!\" shouted Rob. \"Thlr\nway! This way!\"\nA few strokes of tho oar3 brought\nthe boat nearer still, and then tho boat\nwas allowed to drift, while a man\nstood In the bow ready to selzo tha\nperson who needed help as soon ts he\ncame in reach.\n\"Light, quick!\" said this man in the\nbow.\nSuddenly a gleam lit up the dark\nness, and tho rays of a small lantern\nwero turned on tho water. Rob waa\nthen about ten feet from tho boat He\nat once took a few strokes toward It\nHe was seized in tho strong hands of\nthe man in tie bow, and in a moment\nmore was dragged into the boat.\nHis life had been saved by smug\nglers.The lantern was extinguished, and\ncn Instant later a light was displayed\non the deck of tho \"Black Cat.\" To\nward this the men rowed, and In about\nfivo minutes more Rob, shivering,\nsoggy with soaked clothing, and ready\nto shout and laugh and cry all at once,\nfrom his mixed emotions, stood on the\nschooner's deck.\n(To be continued.)\nDoing l'enance for Sin,\nIn former times persons guilty or\ngrievous and notorious offenses were\nrequired to make open confession and\nfurther to make satisfaction for the\nscandal given by their bad example by\ndoing penanco publicly in a white\nsheet in their parish church, says\nStray Stories. Tho sheet waa used to\nKhow clearly to every cno which wa3\nthe offender. The last time that pub\nlic penanco was done In an English\nchurch was on Sunday evening, July\nSO, 1S32, when a man named Martree,\nin the Church of All Saints, East Mar\ntree, made an open confession of im\nmorality and promised to perform the\npenance thus imposed upon him by\nthe vicar. No white sheet was used\non this occasion. Tho last case In\nwhich one was used appears to have\nbeen one in St. Bridget's church, Ches\nter, in 1851. But on that occasion the\npenance was not public, the chnrcn\ndoor being locked. In the previous year\nhowever, public penance In a white\nsheet was done in a country church In\nEssex and a similar thing occurred In\nDItton church, near Cambridge, In\n1849.\nMeteorological Vt of th Kit.\nIn the meteorological section of the\nBritish association Mr. Rotch gave an\naccount of the work done at the Blue\nHill meteorological observatory, Mas\nsachusetts, by means of kites during\nthe last year. The maximum height\nattained was 12,410 feet in February\nof this year. Tho fact that the In\ncrease of altitude obtained this year 19\nsmaller than in former years seems ta\nindicate that tho extreme height to\nwhich the kites can rise Is being ap\nproached. The attempt of the United\nStates weather bureau to secure dally\nrecords with kites at sixteen stations\nwas unsuccessful for forecasting on\naccount of light winds, which pre\nvented dally flights at all the station,\nbut many data were obtained simul\ntaneously In the freo air nnd at the\nground.",

    "Where Your Taxes Go\nHow Uncle Sam Spends Your Money\nin Conducting Your Business\nBy EDWARD G. LOWRY\nAuthor \"Washington CloM-Ups.\" \"Banks and Financial Systems.\" eto. Contributor\nPolitical and Economic Articles to Leading Periodicals and a Writer of Recognized\nAuthority on the National Government's Business Methods.\nI\nCopyright, Western\nVII.\nHY GOOD MEN DODGE\nThe government service must look\nrgely. to the graduates from colleges\nid universities in recruiting for its\nclinical work, Replies to an Inquiry\n1 dressed to some forty of the leading\n(lieges and universities of the pouh\ny to discover what class of men took\nvll service examinations, whether\nte number Is decreasing and, If so,\nte reasons, disclose vividly what the\nRifling schools of technical^ and sclcn\nBc men think about the government\nThey warn their\nf\u00e2 I an employer,\ngraduates against government service,\npid the graduates heed the wurnlng.\npj; Curnegle Institute of Technology,\nat Pittsburgh, reports:\ngit Is certainly true that the best of our\nVaduates are not Interested In govern\nment employment because they feel that,\nArst of all. It does not pay adequate sal\naries, nor does It offer opportunity for\nadvancement that private enterprise does.\nThis spring I interviewed ail the mem\nbers of the graduating class, except the\nwomen, and none of them would consider\ngovernment employment, although there\nwore many positions open. . . . There\n: .are now . bout 1,600 male graduates of the\nInstitute, and I will venture to state that\nnot more than ten are employed by the\n; government.\n; Replies of similar tenor and import\nr were received from the University of\nChicago, Lelaad Stanford university,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nPtlneeton university, Indiana univer\nsity, and the University of Wisconsin.\nInequality of compensation is one\n\u00abf the chief reasons that deter scien\ntific men from going Into the govern\nment service. Congress fixes the sal\naries of most of the government em\nployees. I can give a concrete Illus\ntration of how it determines the sal\naries of scientific men.\nDr. Leland O. Howard and Dr. Ed\nward W. Nelson are two scientists In\nthe employ of the government who\nhave\nnational\nreputations.\nThe appropriation bill for the De\npartment of Agriculture was under\nconsideration In the house on January\nSOth, 1920. The secretary of agricul\nture had been recommending for five\nor six years that Doctor Howard's\n\u00abalary be increased from $4,500 to $5,\n\u00ab 00 .\nHe proposed It again in that\nyear's bill. When the Item was reached\nin the discussion on the floor, this col\nloquy ensued :\nMr. Stafford\u2014Mister Chairman, I re\nserve a point of order on the paragraph.\nIs the entomologist whose salary you\npropose to increase the same person reo\nommended for an Increase last year?\nMr. Lever\u2014Yes; he has been in the gov\nernment service many, many years.\nThe Chairman\u2014I make the point of or\n<9er.\nSYSTEM IS ALL WRONG\nThe groat difficulty that stands In\nthe way of discussing Uncle Sam as\nan employer Is that there is no such\nperson. The men who stand in the\nrelation of employer to their subordi\nnates are nothing but employees them\nselves, and temporary ones at that,\nwith a very fleeting tenure of office.\nCabinet officers and members of con\ngress, to whom the rank and file of\nemployees look for guidance for a\nsolution of their problems, are simply\nfleeting figures that come and go, with\ntheir own Interests to serve. They\ntestify freely enough as to conditions\nof government employment. Senator\nCarter Glass, recently secretary of the\ntreasury, for example:\n\"The largely multiplied business of\nthe government cannot be conducted\nwith efficiency and ecouomy unless\nthere be attracted to and retained In\nthe public service a group of highly\ntrained, well-paid and permanent offi\nciais of supervisory grades. Uncer\ntainty of tenure In some Instances and\nInadequacy of compensation have\ngjosed the public service to many men\not the best type or forced them out of\ngovernment employ at the moment of\ntheir greatest usefulness.\n\"The war has lncreasisi the public\ndebt more than twenty-five fold and\nhss augmented the functions and ac\ntivities of the government In many\nw\u00bbye. The duties ure greater and the\nresponsibilities are larger than those\nof other days, to the standards of\nwhlcb It Is not to be expected that\nthe government wlli ever return. The\nconditions ure such that failure to take\nthe necessary action to Invite and\nJlfltd In the public service nieu of ex\nCOpiionui ability and of real dlstiuc\n04MI In their fields rail result only in\n\u00abgave burdens to \u00ablie taxpayers of the\nggUUll'y und lu possible disaster.\nR*' Already the transacte\nfcgsi. coa of the gimiiiiui'i\npth <i by deficiencies of pci\nb th# n\nOf fjitf\n\u00bb Lout\nV of\ni ni to pr\n\u00c9.ai of\nilttg\nI |.\nji\nMil'\nI\n!\nNewspaper Union\nMr. Lever\u2014 I concede It.\nMr. McLaughlin of Michigan\u2014Will th\u00ab\nK Mr. e \u2122ta!fford\u2014Fwill^reserve ft I\nMr. McLaughlin\u2014The committee made\nthe recommendation to increase the sal\nary $500, took testimony on It and con\nsidered It very carefully. In our judg*- (\nment the Increase in salary ought to be\nmade for an official who has been in th\u00ab\nthe chairman says, for a\nlong time at the head of this bureau Hi j\nhas performed able and faithful services.\nThe salary is less than that paid to the\nheads of other bureaus. We felt, aftei I\nlistening to all that was said, and with a j\ndepartment,\nknowledge of the work he has been doing\nand has done, the salary proposed l* not\ntoo large.\nMr. Stafford\u2014How long has he been\nthere?\nMr. Lever\u2014He has been there forty-twc\nyears.\nMr Stafford\u2014What la his age?\nMr. Lever\u2014Over sixty, perhaps nearei\nseventy, but he is still vigorous and abl\u00ab\nto do good work. He Is one of th\u00ab\ngreatest entomologists In the world.\nThe Chairman\u2014The point of order li\nsustained.\nFive minutes later the matter of\nDoctor Nelson's salary was reached.\nThe secretary of agriculture recom\nmended an increase of his pay from\n$3,500 to $4,000. This happened :\nMr. Stafford\u2014Mister Chairman, I ra\nthe point of order on the para\nserve\ngraph. , Will the chairman of the com\nmittee Inform the house as to how long\nthis biologist has been in the servie,\nof the government and how long he has\n.. receiving the present salary of \u00bb.\"500.\nwhich you recommend an.increase- ot\nbeen\non\n$600?\nMr. Lever\u2014Mister Chairman, this gen\ntleman, whose name Is Nelson, has been\nin the' service of the department since\nNovember, 1890. He has served as chiei\nfield naturalist from 1907 to 1912, and was\nassistant In charge of the biological in\nvestigatlon. from 1913 to 19H. On August\n6 . 1914, he was appointed assistant chiei\nof the bureau, and on December 1. 1916.\nmade chief of the bureau. He took\nthe place of Doctor Henshaw.\nMr. Stafford\u2014And the salary has been\nJ3.500 since 1916?\nMr' Stafford\u2014 -What ts hts age?\nMr. Lever\u2014 I should think that Doctor\nNelson is round fifty years of age.\nMr. Stafford\u2014He is not superannuated.\nMr. Lever Oh. no; he is a very vigor\nv. a s\nous man.\nMr. Stafford\u2014Mister Chairman, I with\ndraw the point of order.\nDoctor Howard was refused his in\ncrease of pay because he was too olft,\n\"over sixty, perhaps nearer seventy.''\nDoctor Nelson was allowed his in\ncrease because he was not superan\nnuated but In his prime, \"round fifty\nyears of age.\"\nNow, as a matter of fact, Doctoi\nHoward Is more than two years young\ner than Doctor Nelson. Is it any won\nder that scientific men of any attain\nments are reluctant to enter a service\nwhere the measure of the value ol\ntheir services is set down in any such\nhaphazard and casual way?\nthe field of private enterprise. They\nwere too fine and too patriotic to leave\ntheir posts.\n\"Under the compelling force of pa\ntriotism they made willing sacrifices\nduring the war, but with the return of\npeace the government cannot expect\nto retain these employees indefinitely,\nbecause in justice to themselves and\ntheir families they will sooner or later\naccept the larger opportunities that are\nopen to them In the world of business\nand industry unless the government\nproposes to pay them salaries that at\nleast reasonably approach the value ol\ntheir services.\n\"Only prompt action by the congress\nto build up a permanent and dignified\ncivil service which will Include men\nof great ability and high attainments\ncan prevent mistakes and failures iD\nthe transaction of the public business,\nthe consequences of which may be\nEx-Representative Good, who was\nchairman of the appropriations com\nmittee of the house.

This is but a\nshort span iu the lives of many, and\nthere are those who look back upon\nthat period as it being but of yester\nday. Yet when one glances back it is\nto marvel at the accomplishments of\nthat period. One of the most striking\nof these is the progress that has been\nmade in Western Canada since that\nday, forty years ago, when an official\nof the railway placed his signature to\nthe document that gave possession to\nthe new owner of a section of land.\nThis was the first sign of the wealth\nthat in time would be added to the\nwealth of the world in forty years,\nthis single section of land being the\nbase upon which the future would be\nbuilt. The potential wealth was but\nin embryo; today it Is a big. living\nreality. Among the many things that\nreveal tills, may be seen the winnings\nmade by Western Canada exhibitors at\nthe International Live Stock show held\nin Chicago in 1921. These were so\nmarked in their number as to give to\nthe world\u2014the American world\u2014a\nsplendid idea of the excellence of the\nproducts of the farms of the new but\nrapidly developing country lying to the\nnorth of the international boundary\nline.\nThe results of the exhibition show,\naccording to the Manitoba Free Press,\nthat in live stock and grain exhibits\nthe three prairie provinces of Canada\nmade something like 150 winnings.\nEvery animal sent from the province\nof Alberta won a prize. Exhibits In\ncluded Shorthorn and Hereford cattle\nand Percheron and Clydesdale horses.\nAn Alberta-bred heifer got fourth place\nin a class of eighteen outstanding in\ndividuals. In grain, Alberta made sim\nply an astounding record, securing the\nsweepstakes for oats, and eight or nine\nprizes before even the American ex\nhibitors secured a placing, and while\nthe grand championship for wheat\nwent to Montana, the prairie provinces\ntook 23 out of 25 possible placings.\nThe first prize for alfalfa seed was\nawarded for seed grown at Brooks,\nAlberta, in competition with 43 entries.\nAlfalfa-growing in Western Canada\nhas been increasing by leaps and\nbounds, and this victory will give it\nand the dairy industry, which is al\nways linked with it, a further impetus.\nIn live stock classes alone Saskatch\newan had sixty entries and took sixty\nfour ribbons.\nThe winning of the grand champion\nship for Clydesdale stallions by a\nSaskatchewan horse, for the second\ntime in succession, was almost excep\ntional. He was bred on a Western\nCanada farm, fitted and prepared for\nexhibition there, and able to win over\nhorses shown from the studs of men\nwho have unlimited money to spend\non the breeding and preparation of\ntheir exhibits. This is proof positive\nthat the farmers of Western Canada\nare not only in a position to breed\ntheir own horse power, and that of a\nvery high quality, but to breed horses\nthat will be saleable in any market\nnt the world.\nManitoba takes just pride In the fact\nthat a Percheron stallion, first in his\nclass and Canadian-bred champion,\nwas bred by Vance, of Crandall, Mani\ntoba. Manitoba took G 4 places outside\nof the grain exhibits.\nWhen all is said and done, the real\ntriumphs are the wins of both live stock\nand grains actually produced in the\ngreat Canadian provinces.\nCommenting upon the enterprise of\n| agriculturists of Western Canada in\nsending exhibits to the International\nTaste is a matter of\ntobacco quality\nWe state it as our honest\nbelief that the tobaccos used\nin Chesterfield are of finer\nquality (and hence of better\ntaste) than in any other\ncigarette at the price.\nLiggett & Myers Tobacco Ct.\nChesterfield\nCIGARETTES\nLower Prices\n20 now 18c\n10 dow 9c\n(Two ID's\u2014l\u00dfc)\nm fl)\nK. \u00ae /fl./\nAspirin\nWARNING!

The old\nblack man hobbled to the door and\ngaed out across the icy world of\nsnow. I he wind and the snow came\nrushing in and the old Inan shivered\ntifl his \"onliest two te-f\" chattered\nwith cold.\nThe plaintive cry of a little child\ncame again across the snow. It went\ntraight to the old man's heart and\nhe wished with all his power of long\ning that he might have strength to\ngo out and f'nd the unfortunate little\none.\nA third time the wailing cry came,\nand tin n a wonderful thing happened.\nA miraculous power filled the old\nman's 'viins. His muscles became\nstrong and tense, his crutch fell back\nInto the cabin and he hleppt d from\nthe threshold out into the snow.\nlie hurried over the snow with an\nactivity he had not possessed since\nboyhood, and by and by he came to a\nlittle child in a snow bank.\nAs the child's little form touched\nhim a great, new strength came to\nhim which seemed to give him wing.\nto speed back to his little cabin.\nlie placed the child upon the bed\nand tenderly drew the ragged quilt\nabout it and then he looked to see if\nthere might bo a piece of furniture of\nwhich to make a lire to warm the little\none.\nAt that very instant a great log\nrolled across the threshold and into\nthe fireplace. The little child looked\nat the log with eyes like stars, which\nsent gleams of light that kindled the\nlog with the most brilliant fire the\nold man had ever seen.\nThe dingy little room was tilled with\nradiance ami warmth, and as the light\nwrapped the child he laughed and\nlaughed like a song of the heart. The\nold man turned his ees to where the\nlire burned and watched the flames\nleap in beautiful rainbow tints over\nthe log, forming the shape of a cross\nin fire.\nHome Made Largest variety Prices within reach of all\nWe will be better prepared this year than ever before to take care of the holiday\ntrade.

A strange Christmas\nj will it be among the belligerent na\nj lions. In thousands of homes, strick\n' en by the loss of dear ones or with\nloved oneststill on the danger line,\nI Christmas festivities will seem alto\ngether out of place. Among those\nI made destitute by the war, there will\nj be little Christmas cheer except as\nj others carry it to them, l'.ut our sym\n1 pathy for those who sutler should not\n! rob us altogether of the good cheer\nJ that Christmas brings with it, or of\n; the gift-making which characterizes\nI the season. No child should look back\nj upon a Christmas without a tree, toys\nI and good things.\nI The suggestion that no Christmas\ni presents be bought this year, ami that\nI the money thus saved be sent to the\nI relief of Europe's war victims, will\nI not make a popular appeal. Were\nj no Christmas purchases made this\n(year it would by no means follow that\nall, or a large part, of the money sav\ned would be sent to the sufferers In\nt Europe. The laws of human nature\n1 are such that if all Christmas givings\n! were checked it would tend to stop\nalso the charity which has for weeks\nbeen flowing to Europe. The majority\nof people would reason that if they\ncouldn't buy presents for their chil\ndren or friends they could not afford\nto contribute to relief funds. Do\npeople realize, too, what business dis\nturbance would result If Christmas\nbuying were curtailed on a large\nscale. The Christmas trade represents\noften the yearly profits. If that\ntrade were suddenly and seriously\nly curtailed it would mean disaster\nfor hundreds of stores and for thou\nsands of employees.\n, J.ut this Christmas does give an op-\nportuniiy for certain much-desired re\ni forms. liecent years have witnessed\na growing tendency to senseless giv\ning. Many presents are mad; with no\nthought other than paying -a debt or\nestablishing a credit. There Is no bet\nter time than now to cut out such\ncommercialism, and to make all giv\ning reflect the true Christmas spirit.\nWhen we do this we shall have all\nthe customary joy of the season in the\nhome and in friendship's circle. Wh\nwill be in the mood also to remember\nthe suffering thousands across the sea,\nand in our own land the needy ones\nwho will be in far greater numbers\nthis year than usual.

    "When There's a National Crisis,\na Black Cat Moves in Under\nthe Capitol Dome; When the\nDanger Ends, It Leaves\ns'V-S\n\u201cIt Spat at Me, ami Then It Sort of\nSwelled up. Like a Balloon, and Sailed\nOver My Head.\u201d\nEVERYBODY can take a deep\nbreath now and relax. The\nCapitol\u2019s legendary black cat has\nvanished again.\nFor four years there were ro\ntated accounts of an ebony smudge\nof feltnttv that lurked in the dark\nsubterranean tunnels of the nation\u2019s\nCapitol by day, leaving the cavernous\nregions at night to creep up the nar\nrow, musty circular staircase and\npace majestically past the marble\nsolons in Statuary Hall.\nAnd that was strictly according\nto Washington tradition, because any\nCapitol attendant with an ounce of\nsu|>erstition in his soul can tell you\nthat the same black cat\u2014well, maybe\nit\u2019s the same\u2014has prowled under the\nhuge golden dome during every na\ntional crisis for more that a century.\nSelf-designated historians declare\nthat Dolly Madison brought the black\ncat \u2014or anyhow, a black cat to the\nCapitol in 1811, when only the two\nwings had been built. It stayed be\nhind, they say, when Dolly fled Wash\nington before the advancing British\nin 1814, vanished when the war ended,\nand returned for a brief spell during\nthe Mexican War of 1847.\nWhen the War Between the States\nbroke out- so the legend goes the\nmidnight mouser moved in for a nice\nlong visit, culminating only with the\nsurrender of Lee at Appomattox.\nNovember I. IfllA\n24\n-\u2018Jmm\nExit Again\nHklfc Cat\nDuring the next three decades the\nstory of the grim grimalkin was al\nmost forgotten, but sure enough,\nalong about the time the battleship\nMaine blew up like a junior atomic\nIvjinb in Havana llarl>or, some war\nmongering w'arlock once more let the\ncat out of the bag. Anyhow, in all\nits inky glory, it is said to have sat\nout the Spanish imbroglio in the con\nfines of the Capitol, and when World\nWar I began there it w-as again.\nIt was during that conflict that\nthe nocturnal wanderer was re\nported to have made its most spec\ntacular sortie. A new guard, who\nhad never heard the legend of the\ndemon cat. was plodding his rounds\nthrough Statuary Hall, a ghostly\nenough spot even during the day but\npositively spectral when the moon\nlight flickers over the graven images\nof the bygone great.\nSuddenly he saw a dark patch\nglide across the marble base of a\nstone statesman. It was, he said,\nunmistakably, a cat, black as ink,\nand it had no business hobnobbing\nwith the alabaster wraiths. He seat\ned it a couple of times and then gave\nchase. As described by him, it was\nouite a chase. They slithered past\nBuchanan, circled Adams (John\nQuincy), skidded around Polk, cir\ncumnavigated Jackson and dashed\nbehind Ben Harrison\u2019s back. \u2022\nThe cat, always just ahead, looked\noccasionally to bare its teeth. Then\nsuddenly. ..\n\u201cIt turned on me,\u201d he related\nlater. \"It spat at me, and then it\nsort of swelled up, like a balloon,\nand sailed over my head. I turned\naround and poof! It was gone. Just\nlike that. Nobody will ewer catch\nme chasing a cat again.\u201d\nThe guard didn't tell his story for\nseveral days, and when he* did. none\nof his fedlovv custodians se*e*me*d a\u2019\nall surprised. They chime*d in with\ntheir own experiences,\nnone so dramatic but all\nroncemed with a Mack\ncat that appeared in the\nhall only at night.\nThe saga of the* tonuems\ntabby is incomplete in\nmany spots, but according\nto the* most willing inform\nants, the* cat stayed away\nfor only a few years after\nthe war and returne'd.\nwithout e*vcn a gray hair,\non the e*ve of the great\npanic of 1929.\nThe current guards play\nfully name*d it \u201cSenator\nBlack,\u201d after the pre*sent\nSupreme Court Justice\nwho was then a fle'dgling\nsolon.

Not a bit of It. Did you\never toe Torrevo drunk? I did not. I\ntell you it was a put up Job. Torrevo\nv knew you always looked at the in\nvoices and tally, and he played this\nlittle game for you to ses how well tie\nboy wrote.

Wo can reach\n''J^Vthe 'Black Cat' before morning. They\nwill not sail till then. We may even\novertake the boy.\"\nNow that his stupor was over, Elvin\nv could think and act quickly. He re\n's alized the danger In which he and his\nBon stood aa long as this Intrepid and\nIntelligent young American was alive\nand at large. He ordered horses to be\nSaddled, and, after a drink to brace\ntheir nerves, father and son sat out on\ntheir errand\u2014two men, to run down\nand kill a boy.\nThere was a moon, and the way was\neasily made. The horsea were put to\ntheir utmost, and mile after mile was\ncovered, but no Rob was seen.\nSuddenly Starne drew up and called\nto Elvin.\n\"Hist!\" he said. \"Thert is a man\ncoming this way oh foot.\"\nElvin reined in his horse and eat\nlooking In the direction Indicated by\nStarne.\n\"By JoTel\" lie exclaimed. \u2022That's\nTorrevo!\"\nAnd Torrero it was, making his way\non foot from the \"Black Cat\" to El\nste'a \u00a3\u00bb*dquartera.\nCHAPTER XlVk\nElvin and Btarne rode toward him\n\u2022lowly.\n\"Be ready for treachery,\" said\nStarne. \"Have your pistol in your\nhand. This fellow must be up to mis\nchief\nTorrero saw them coming, but\nwalked on as if he feared nothing.\nEven had he stood in fear of his life\nthere was no place to hide.\n\"Well,\" said Elvin, maintaining an\noutward coolness he did not feel.\n\"What are you doing here? I thought\njrou were to go to Montevideo.\"\n\"True, Captain Elvin. I am going.\nBut I thought perhaps my nephew\nwould be done with his neW duties by\nnow, and, as he has become very valu\nable on board, I am taking a walk out\nto your place to get him.\"\n\"Your nephew!

Though Denver\nnumbers only 1GO.OOO souls within her\ncity limits, she boasts of not lesa than\n40,080 bicycles. Morning and evening\nalike thousands of bicycles may be\nseen on the streets of Denver mounted\nby men, women and children in every\nwalk of life. Bicycles literally overrun\nthings and they are used in every lina\nof business, and street car companies\nsay they have lost $1,000,000 annually\nin traffic since bicycles have become\nthe rage. Id fact, one company went\ninto the hands of a receiver two years\nago, alleging that the universal wheel\nhad impaired ita earning to such an\nextent that it could not meet its inter\nest demands. The open weather and\nfine natural roads arc largely respon\nsible for the popularity of the wheel,\nas it is conceded that ordinary riders\ncan use their wheels daily for 50 weeks\nout of 52 and not suffer any annoyance\nfrom mud or enow. Add to this the\nfact that neither lights,brakes nor bells\nare required and the agility required\nof the non-rider in taking care of him\nself can be appreciated. Denver is\nsaid to be the only city in the country\nwhere the bicycle vote controls elec\ntions on municipal Issues.\nBanana Is a Prolific Planfc\nA banana stalk yields but one buncli\ncf fruit, and would die if it were not\ncut down when the fruit ripens or ma\ntures. One mat will produce from one\nto three bunches a year, growing con\ntinuously, as fast as one stalk 1a cut\nanother taking its place. A remarka\nble thing about this plant is that If\nyou cut into a half-grown stalk near\nthe root, or any part of the stalk, a\nsmall blosoom, or bunch of bananas,\nfully formed will soon shoot through\nthe cut, but if allowed to grow wtll\nnever reach any market value. Many\npeople affirm that the banana and the\nplantain are the same fruit, but this is\nincorrect although th\u00aby grow like the\nbanana cn eyperienced person can\nreauily distinguish the difference by\nthe color as well as by the size of the\nsmall ribs in the leaf. The plantain\ngrows in a bunch, but with only two or\nthree hands to the bunch, and each\nfinger or individual plantain is as large\nagain a3 the banana and Is more of a\ncrescent shape.

    "ROD 6!6V6rflal6'S fldv6ntur6.\n13 y SoiAord\nCopyiltfhted, 1808, by Robert Bonner's\nCHAPTER VIII.\nThere was no answer, and Rob's\nheart sank again. Torrevo was In the\nplot against him, too, and had simply\ncome to satisfy himself that Rob was\nIn his deadly prison.\nAfter a short time perhaps fifteen\nminutes when Rob had given up all\nhope.he heard a greater noise outside.\n\"Now!\" he hear Torrevo say In a\nvoice of command. \"All together.\"\nThere came to Rob the sounds of\nmen grunting as if straining at an\neffort, and suddenly the stone rolled\naway, letting in a flood of daylight.\nThere stood Torreyo and a half dozen\nof the men from the \"Black Cat'\nwhom he had brought to move the\nrock a job too great for one man to\naccomplish.\n\"My Jewel! My Jewel!\" exclaimed\nTorrevo, In an extravagance of ecs\ntasy, grasping Rob and hugging him.\n\"You did that well! You did that\nwell! By the saints, you did that\nwell!\"\nThis was a sudden change again.\nRob wondered what kind of a man\nTorrevo was to brutally strike him\none hour and hug him and call him a\njewel the next.\n\"I don't understand!\" he said. \"I\ndidn't think you were my friend.\"\n\"Not your friend! Indeed, what do\nyou call the man who lets you out of\nthat place?\"\n\"Yes, but that rope's end!\"\nCaptain Torrevo burst into a bois\nterous laugh.\n\"Oh, that! Why, didn't you under\nstand? If I had treated you with\nkindness Elvln would have asked\nquestions. And, when Starne came I\nclubbed you well, so that you would\nnot raise your face for him to see it.\nHo! We did it well! But fcr that\nwe would both be dead now.\"\n\"Did they miss me?\" asked Rob.\n\"No, thank me for that, too. I\nTHERE WAS NO MERCY\ncursed you and said I had t.ent you\non board the schooner. They went\naway, and I set sail for the mouth of\nthe river. Then, when they had time\nto get far away, I came back. I knew\nwhere to find you. Oh! You are wise\nenough. But come on board. You\nmust be hungry.\"\n\"I am starving.\"\nTorrevo led the way back to the\nriver, where the boat from the \"Black\nCat\" was waiting. They were soon\non board, and a substantial meal was\nat once set before Rob, who did full\nJustice to it. Captain Torrevo sat near\nhim smoking while he ate.\n\"I tell you, It was a clo3e shave,\"\nsaid the captain. \"When I saw the\nyoung man I thought it was all up.\nBut I clubbed you well, did I not?\"\n\"I should say so,\" said Rob, shrug\nging his shoulders, which still ached\nfrom the drubbing. \"But what is the\nmeaning of It all?\"\n\"The meaning of It the meaning of\nmy part of it Is this: For some reason\nor other, Starne wanted you to die.\nIf he or Elvln knew I saved your life\ncither one would kill you and me.\nThey stop at nothing. I don't know\nwhy Starne wanted to kill you, but I\nknow enough not to let him kill me.\"\n\"Who are these men?\"\nWell. Elvin Richard Elvin, the\ncaptain is the chief of the Independ\nents. That is a party opposed to ev\nerything in the present government.\nHe\nis the boss of the smugglers, is\nrich,\nlives in Buenos Ayres, and is\nconstantly con3piring in some way\nagainst the government, as well a3\ngetting richer in every way he can.\nThe secret of his wishing your death\nmust be connected with your relatlon\nihip to Horton.\"\n\"But who is Lemuel Starne?\"\n\"He Isn't Lemuel Starne at all. He\nIs Lemuel Elvin, the captain's son.\"\n\"But he hates me.\"\n\"Perhaps not. He may simply want\nto get you out of his way.\"\n\"But how can I be in his way?\"\n\"I don't know. I am not in their\nlecreta.\"\nfife! ftf.k\n, .\"U Elvin so crrtt.1 as to kill a boy J\nVU. Hopkins.\nSons.\nof my age Just because his son hates\nme?\"\n\"Captain Ehin will kill anybody he\nwants to get rid of. He is the most\nsuspected and the most feared of all\nmen in Buenos Ayres. But he Is so\ncrafty that the government cannot\ncatch him.\"\n\"But you! Why do you stick to a\nman like that?\"\n\"Oh! I! Because it is to my ad\nvantage. You see, young senor, we\nare not all in favor of this govern\nment of ours. I did something once\nthat brought me in disfavor. I was\nto be shot. I escaped, with the help\nof Elvin, and turned well, I became\nthe captain of the 'Black Cat.' Richard\nElvin owns me body and soul. Now,\nyou know why I am afraid to let him\nknow I saved your life.\"\n\"But of course the danger Is over\nnow,\" said Rob. \"You can take me to\nBuenos Ayres and let me find my un\ncle. Then your danger will end.\"\nCaptain Torrevo looked at Bob with\nwide-open eyes. It was as if he\nthought Rob had taken leave of his\nsenses.\n\"Take you to Buenos Ayres! Take\nyou to Buenos Ayres! What! Why,\nmy danger would just begin. As long\nas I can keep you here with\" me and\nmake Elvln think you are my nephew,\nI am safe. But once let you to get to\nBuenos Ayres, and Elvln would have\nmy life In an hour.\"\n\"But I would not tell that you sav\ned me.\"\nTorrevo shook his head.\n\"No, no. It will not do,\" he said.\n\"You must give that up. You are one\nof the crew of 'El Gato Negro' now.\nYou must so remain. What! It Is\nnot a bad life. You s?e the world.\nWe live on the best. What more do\nyou want?\"\n\"I want to reach my uncle.\"\nTorrevo turned on him savagely.\nIN THE SCOWLING FACE.\n\"See here!\" he paid in a tone that\ncould not be mistaken. \"I am not\nquite so bad as Elvin or as Starno.\nI Eaved you twice. But if you think\nI am going to run my head in a noose\nto take you to your uncle, you are\nmistaken. You stay here, do you un\nderstand? Obey me and you will get\nalong. But try to play me false and\nI will kill you before Elvin has a\nchance to kill me.\"\nRob looked at him appeallngly.\nThere was no mercy in the dark and\nnow scowling countenance. He stroll\ned on deck and gave sundry orders.\nThe dark crew sprang to work, the\nanchor wa3 raised, and sails spread.\nThe \"Black Cat\" headed down the\nriver.\n\"Where arc we going? Where are\nyou taking me?\" asked Rob, who had\nfollowed Torrevo on deck.\n\"To Rio de Janeiro,\" said Torrevo,\ncalmly. \"Wo go to get another cargo\nof rum and tobacco.\"\nRob stood helplessly, with beating\nheart, sorrowfully watching the waves\nmade by the \"Black Cat\" as she gath\nered headway.\nWas he never to find his uncle? Was\nhe never to see his dear mother again?\nWas he to live and die a prisoner\namong these outlaws?\nThere was no answer to his frantic\nthoughts.\nHe was on his way to Brazil. What\ndisasters might not befall him before\nhe ever saw Buenos Ayres, or even\nNew York, again if, Indeed, he ever\nsaw either?\n\"Go pet some sleep,\" said Torrevo,\nnow losing his severe manner. \"You\nneed sleep; go get it.\"\n\" Rob did not dare disobey even so\nsimple a command. So he went to\nhis cabin, and on the comfortable bed\nsobbed himself to sleep onco more.\nCHAPTER IX.\nThe Journey to Brazil lasted about\ntwo weeks, and passed without any\nnoteworthy incident. Of courso Rob\nwas sorrowful over his gloomy pros\npects, but ho was wise enough to hido\nhis f&elings when Csptaln Torres was\nnear him, and not to make any t4\ntempts to escape Indeed, there was\nno possibility of escape. Rcb might,\nif he felt so inclined, Jump overboard,\nbut they were far out at sea, and to\ncommit so foolhardy an act was sim\nply to leap to his death. So Rob bid\ned his time, took things as easily as\nho could, and waited till the schooner\nshould have returned to Argentina to\ntry and reach his uncle.\nIn truth, Rob'a condition on board\nthe \"Black Cat,\" after that one burst\nof passion from Torrevo, was not hard.\nThe captain exacted no arduous tasks\nfrom him. He was well fed, and had\nhe been there willingly he would have\nfound much to enjoy in the novel equ\nation.The swarthy crew treated him with\na friendliness born of their fear of Tor\nrevo. and their respect for Torrevo's\nfriends.\nSo, by the time the \"Black Cat\"\ncame to her anchorage at an obscure\nspot near the wharfage at Rio de Ja\nneiro, Rob was in a tranquil state of\nmind.\nIt was evident that Torrevo had\nmade this trip many tlme3 before. He\nknew all the ropes, and no sooner had\nthe schooner made anchor than he was\nashore visiting his old cronies and ar\nranging for a fresh cargo to be carried\nto the cave on La Plata.\nOn shipboard Torrevo drank co\npiously, but was never under the influ\nence of the liquor he drank. But Rob\nfound that when free from the neces\nsity of maintaining discipline among\nhis crew he gave free license to his\nappetite. Thus It happened that when\nthe fresh cargo was ready to come\naboard, Capt. Torrevo was hopelessly\nand maudlin drunk. He staggered to\nwhere Rob stood on deck, carrying a\nblank paper in his hand.\n\"See here, boy,\" he said, striving to\nmaintain his equilibrium and speaking\nthickly, \"I can't do this. Old Elvln\ndemands a full tally. He's no fool,\nElvln. See, his people here are not to\nbe trusted. And he don't trust me.\nYou'll have to do this.\"\n\"What is there to do, captain?\"\nasked Rob, somewhat afraid of the\nblackeyed drunkard.\n\"Why, you fool! Mark down what\ncomes aboard. See, now?\"\n\"Oh, yes. I'll do that. You go to\nbed.\"\n\"That's a good boy,\" said Torrevo.\nWith implicit confidence In the\nyoung American he went to his cabin.\nRob procured a pen and Ink from\nthe captain's room and, taking a con\nvenient position on deck, making a\ntable of a square chest, he carefully\njotted down in a clear, firm hand each\narticle as it was brought on board and\nlowered into the hold. There were\nbalc3 of tobacco and bales of silk.\nThere were casks of rum and hundreds\nof bottles of wine. There were more\nrifles and more ammunition enough,\nRob thought, for an army. All these,\nIn proper order, and with each separate\nquantity specified, Rob noted in his\ntally.\nThis took all of two days. By the\ntime the loading was finished Torrevo\nhad slept off his drunkenness and the\n\"Black Cat\" set sail again for the\nsouth.\nRob had done a simple act, but it\nwas destined to have great Influence on\nhis future, as also upon Torrevo's.\nHad Torrevo foreseen the result of\nthat spree he would undoubtedly have\nrestrained himself and remained so\nber.At last, after three weeks' voyaging,\nthe \"Black Cat\" reached her anchorage\nin the little bay. One of the crew was\nsent ashore by Torrevo, and Rob\nlearned that this method was used to\nnotify Captain Elvin when the \"Black\nCat\" arrived with a contraband cargo.\nIn a few hours the tall, ugly English\nman reached the place on horseback,\nand was followed by the same gang of\nswarthy laborers Rob had seen before.\nRob was in constant fear lest Lemuel\nStarne or Lemuel Elvln should also\ncome and recognize him. But the\nyounger man never came there unless\non urgent business with his father, and\nRob was safe thi3 time.\n(To be continued.)\nThe Spectacle Habit.\n\"It is a singular and grotesque fact,\"\nsaid an eye specialist of New Orleans\nto a Times-Democrat man, \"that a\ngreat many uneducated people get into\nthe spectacle habit without any need\nwhatever for wearing glasses. Take\nfor Instance, a man whose eyes be\ncome a little inflamed from exposure\nto the sun or some other cause. His\nsight is all right, and what he really\nneeds is a soothing lotion of some\nsort to allay the irritation of the\nmembrane.. Very frequently, how\never, he will Imagine that he requires\na pair of spectacles, and will buy them\nat the cheapest place he can find\nwithout the slightest regard to the\nsuitability of the lenses. In nine cases\nout of ten it is almost impossible for\nhim to see through the things, but\nhe will wear them as much as he can,\nbelieving that his eyes are being bene\nfited. Such instances are astonishing\nly common among the poorer classes,\nand the peddlers who go through the\ncountry districts always carry several\ndozen cheap 'specs' in their packs.\nThey find a ready sale. I have had\nseveral country people come to me for\ntreatment who were wearing glasses\nthat contained only one lens. They\nwould explain that they took the other\none out so they could see to get\naround. When they were fitted with\nproper lenses they were very much\nsurprised to find they could see better\nthrough them than with their natural\neyes. The wearing of spectacles in\nsomo remote rural district amounts\nalmost to a auperslitlon when peo\nple arrive at a certain age they believe\nthey ought to put them on, regard\nless cf their actual vision.\"\nHI CROSSED 1 1111,11\nBritish Reported In Strong Force\nNorth of River.\nTHE ADVANCE IS BEGUN.\nIlorr Said to He Retiring From South\nof Lutlysuilth IUlief of the Tuivu\nInspected lieu.

    "FOUR\nHUTCHINSON SMS\nTHIN CHILDREN ME\nREALLY ABNORMAL\nPhysician Urges Mothers to\nCorrect First Signs of\nDiscomfort.\n\u201cYou can play and feed and sleep\nyour child out of almost anything un\ndesirable and into almost anything\nreasonable,\u201d says Dr. Woods Hutchin\nson in The Melbourne Leader.\nHe urges mothers to watch the eyes\nof tiny babies to prevent blindness and\nto carefully examine the nose of a\nchild that sniffles. Above all. moth\ners, don\u2019t let your babies get thin.\n\"A thin child is an abnormal child.\u201d\nsays Dr. Hutchinson, \u201cand the best\nsingle remedy for two-thirds of the\nevils affecting growing humanity is a\nhalf inch more padding over their\nbones.\u201d\n\u201cYou can cure almost anything in a\nchild. He has an almost irresistible\ntendency to grow up straght and\nstrong. It is not necessary to bend\nhim or mould him. All you have to\ndo is to give him air and sunlight and\nelbow room, and of his own accord he\nwill grow straght physically, mentally,\nmorally.\n\u201cIt is not necessary to 'begin with\nthe grandparents\u2019 as Oliver Wendell\nHolmes said, or to worry about the\nsips of the fathers, more than about\nonce in 20 cases.\n\u201cNine children out of every 10\u2014yes,\n95 out nf every 100\u2014are perfectly\ngood raw material for man building,\nor woman making, if they are handled\nright.\n\u201cTake care of the averagd child,\nand the exceptional child will take\ncare of himself.\nDANGERS OF INFECTION.\n\u201cTo begin at the very beginning, the\nfirst possible handicap against which\na child should be guarded is that of\nInfection of his tiny eyelids during the\nprocess of birth.\n\u201cAs soon as his eyes open to the\nlight, a few drops of a harmless, anti\nseptic silver solution should be\ndropped into them, for this simple\ncharm is an absolutely safe magic\nagainst one-fifth of his possible\nchances of becoming an inmate of a\nblind asylum.\n\u201cAn infection, which ought not to\noccur anywhere\u2014but, which alas\u2019 does\nexist in every class and circle\u2019 of so\nciety\u2014by getting into the tender eyes\nof newborn babies supplies our\nschools for blind with a fifth of their\ninmates.\n\u201cIt is humiliating that such a pro\ncedure should be necessary, but there\nIs no blinking the fact that it is. and\ntwo drops of salty water in the eyes\nare a very tiny price to pay for secur\nity.\n\u201cThe next point about the baby to\nbe watched is his pink little pug of a\nnose. See that he breathes easily and\nnoiselessly through his tiny air fun\nnels. There is no difficulty in inspect\ning them, for they point straight for\nward. and you can almost look right\nthrough them to the back of his head,\nfiguratively speaking.\nSNIFFLES DEMAND ATTENTION.\n\u201cThe minute he begins to sniffle, or\nsneeze, or snuffle, call the doctor\u2019s at\ntention to him at once.

Like\nthem too I feel the glory of life has\n\u2022 gone; but my content at least,\u201d and\n; she bent her head meekly, \u201chas never\nrested I hope too much on this world.\u201d\n\u201cYou are depressed, dear Sybil?\u201d\n\u201cI am unhappy. I am anxious\nabout my father. I fear that he is\nsurrounded by\u2019 men unw\u2019orthy of his\nconfidence. These scenes of violence\nalarm me. Under any circumstances\nI should shrink from them, but I am\nimpressed with the conviction that\nthey can bring us nothing but disaster\nand disgrace.\u201d\n\u201cI honor your father,\u201d said Egre\nmont; \u201cI know no man whose charac\nter I esteem so truly noble; such a\njust compound of intelligence and\ncourage, and gentle and generous im\npulse. I should deeply grieve were he\nto compromise himself. But you have\ninfluence over him. the greatest, as you\nhave over all. Counsel him to return\nto Mowbray.\u201d\n\u201cCan I give counsel?\u201d said Sybil, \u201cI\nwho have been wrong in all my judg\nments! I came up to this city w\u2019ith\nhim to be his guide, his guardian.\nWhat arrogance! What short-sighted\npride! I thought the people all felt\nas I feel; that I had nothing to do\nbut to sustain and animate him; to\nencourage him when he flagged, to\nuphokl him when he wavered. I\nthought that moral power must gov\nern the world, and that moral power\nwas embodied in an assembly whose\nannals will be a series of petty in\ntrigues, or, tfhat is worse, of violent\nmachinations.\u201d\n\u201cExert every\u2019 energy.\u2019\u2019 said Egre\nmont, \u201cthat your father should leave\nLondon immediately; tomorrow, to\nnight if possible. After this business\nat Birmingham the government must\nact. I hear that they will immediately\nincrease the army and the police; and\nthat there is a circular from the secre\ntary of state to the lords lieutenant of\ncounties. But the government will\ncur, and should be attended to at\nonce.\n\u201cBesides, which, about once in five\ntimes snuffles in a very young baby,\nwithin the first week, mean something\nelse which calls for immediate atten\ntion, if you want him to grow up with\nany satisfaction to himself or any re\nspect for his father.\nDO NOT CRY FOR FUN.\n\u201cChildren never cry simply for the\npleasure of hearing 'their own voices,\nstill less to develop their lungs, as the\nsilly 'old nursery belief used to run.\u2014\n\u201cWhen they cry they are uncom\nfortable. Either they are hungry, or\nfatigued, or in pain. The scream is\nnature\u2019s signal, \u2018\u2019Tention!\u2019 and you\nshould never rest until you have dis\ncovered the cause and removed it. If\nyou can\u2019t do this get expert advice.\n\u201cIf a child cries a good deal without\nobvious cause and tries to bury\u2019 one\nside of its head in the pillow, or if old\nenough, puts up its hands towards\nits head, it is very\u2019 likely to mean ear\nache and inflammation of the drum,\nwhich ought, of course, to be attend\ned to at once.\n\u201cIf a child screams when it is taken\nup or jolted or moved suddenly\u2014elim\ninating, of course, the pestilent pin\u2014\nit may mean the beginning of spinal\ntrouble, or scurvy, or rheumatism, or\nrickets.\n\u201c \u2018Growing pains\u2019 usually mean that\nsomething else is growing beside the\nchild, such as neuritis, or rheumatism,\nor infantile paralysis, or flat-foot, or\nspinal curvature. The term is simply\na cover for our ignorance; healthy\ngrowth never hurts.\nHEALTHY CHILD IS HAPPY.\n\u201cIf a child flinches from the light, or\nwears his forehead in a perpetual\nfrown or peers at things between nar\nrowed lids, don\u2019t scold him for mak\ning ugly faces, but send him to an\noculist.\n\u201cIn a young child sensitiveness to\nlight that is not excessively glaring\nand bright is usually a sign of astig\nmatism; peering between half-closed\nlids denotes shortsightedness or myo\npia; a frowning forehead, and a fret\nful, unhappy appearance may mean\neither eye strain or dyspepsia.\n\u201cA healthy child ought to look com\nfortable and act happy. The best gen\neral guide is to keep him, as it were,\nconstantly running upon an even keel,\nwith a good color, a good rfppetite,\na cheerful expression, loud voice, and\na ready' laugh.\n\u201cAll this nonsense about children\nkeeping quiet is born purely of pa\nrental selfishness. No child who is\nhealthy can be happy without making\na whole lot of the most abominable\nnoise, and you might just as well\nmake up your mind to it in advance,\nif you want to raise that kind of\nyoungster.\nKEEP BABY FAT.\n\u201cAnother handicap which a child\nought to be delivered from\u2014and nine\ntenths of all children can be\u2014is skin\nniness. \u2019A man,\u2019 says the old Span\nish proverb, \u2018should be fierce,\u2019 and a\nchild should be fat, or something like\nthat.\n\u201cTo be hard and gaunt and \u2018fit\u2019 is an\nideal only for adults\u2014and is easily\noverdone by them; but it is utterly\ninapplicable to a growing child. The\none thing he or she must have is mar\ngin, surplus.\n\u201cTo keep a child lean and spare\nfrom his fifth to his twelfth year is to\ncheat him out of an inch or more in\nheight and 10 or 15 potinds in weight.\nThinness and leanness in a healthy\nchild mean just one thing, that it isn\u2019t\ngetting enough to eat of the right\nkinds of food.\n\u201cA thin child is an abnormal child;\nand the best single remedy\u2019 and cure\nall for two-thirds of the evils which\naffect growing humanity is half an\ninch more padding ever their bones.\n\u201cYou can feed and sleep and play\nyour child\u2014and the greatest of these\nis feeding\u2014out of almost anything un\ndesirable and into almost anything in\nreason.\n\u201cThe most serious handicap under\nwhich any child can labor\u2014and the\ncommonest, alas! even in prosperous\nsociety\u2014is too little rich food.\u201d\nstrike at the convention. The mem\nbers who remain will be the victims.\nIf your father return to Mowbray and\nbe quiet, he has a chance of not being\ndisturbed.\u201d\n\u201cAn ignoble end of many lofty\nhopes,\u201d said Sybil.\n\u201cLet us retain our hopes.\u201d said\nEgremont, \"and cherish them.\u201d\n\u201cI have none,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cAnd I am sanguine,\u201d said Egre\nmont. \u2022\n\u201cAh! because you have made a\nbeautiful speech. But they will listen\nto you, they will cheer you, but they\nwill never follow you. The dove and\nthe eagle will* not mate; the lion and\nthe lamb will not lie down together;\n; and the conquerors will never rescue\n1 the conquered.\u201d\nEgremont shook his head. \u201cY\u2019ou\nstill will cherish these phantoms, dear\nSybil and why? They are not visions\nof delight. Believe me, they are as\nvain as they are distressing. The mind\nof England is the mind ever of the\nrising race. Trust me it is with the\npeople. And not the less so, because\nthis feeling is one of which even in a\ngreat degree it is unconscious. Those\nopinions which you have been educat\ned to dread and mistrust are opinions\nthat are dying away. Predominant\nopinions are generally the opinions of\nthe generation that is vanishing. Let\nan accident, which speculation could\nnot foresee, the balanced state at this\nmoment of parliamentary parties\ncease, and in a few years, more or\nless, cease it must, and you will wit\nness a development of the new mind\nof England, which will make up by\nits rapid progress for its retarded ac\ntion. I live among these men, I know\nthe principles which they have im\nbibed, and I know, however hindered\nby circumstances for the moment,\nthose principles must bear their fruit.\nIt will be a produce hostile to the oli\ngarchical system. The future principle\nof English politics will not be a level\ning principle; not a principle adverse\nto privileges but favorable to their\nextension. It will seek to ensure\nequality, not by leveling the few, but\nby elevating the many.\u201d\nIndulging for some little time in the\nmutual reflections which the tone of\nthe conversation suggested, Sybil at\nlength rose, and saying that she hoped\nby this time her father might have\nreturned, bade farewell to Egremont,\nbut he also rising would for a time\naccompany her. At the gate of the\ngardens however she paused, and said\nwith a soft sad smile, \u201cHere we must\npart,\u201d and extended to him her hand.\n\u201cHeaven will guard over you!\u201d said\nEgremont, \u201cfor you are a celestial\ncharge.\u201d\nCHAPTER HI.\nAs Sybil approached her home, she\nrecognized her father in the court be\nfore their house, accompanied by sev\neral men, with whom he seemed on\nthe point of going forth. She was so\nanxious to speak to Gerard, that she\ndid not hesitate at once to advance.\nThere was a stir as she entered the\ngate; the men ceased talking, some\nstood aloof, all welcomed her with\nsilent respect. With one or two Sybil\nwas not entirely- unacquainted; at\nleast by name or person. To them, as\nshe passed, she bent her head; and\nthen going up to her father, who was\nabout to welcome her, she said, in a\ntone of calmness and with a semblance\nof composure, \u201cIf you are going out,\ndear father, I should like to see you\nfor one moment first.\u201d\n\u201cA moment, friends,\u201d said Gerard,\n\u201cwith your leave;\u201d and he accom\npanied his daughter into' the house.\nHe would have stopped in the hall,\nbut she walked on to their room, and\nGerard, though pressed for time, was\ncompelled to follow her.- When they\nhad entered their chamber, Sybil\nclosed the door with care, and then,\nGerard sitting, or rather leaning care\nlessly, on the edge of the table, she\nsaid, \u201cWe are once more together,\ndear father; we will never again be\nseparated.\u201d\nGerard sprang quickly on his legs,\nhis eye kindled, his cheek flushed.\n\"Something has happened to you,\nSybil!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head\nmournfully, \u201cnot that; but something\nmay happen to you.\u201d\n\u201cHow so, my child?\u201d said her fa\nther, relapsing into his customary\ngood tempered placidity, and speaking\nin an easy, measured, almost drawling\ntone that was habitual to him.\n\u2022 To Be Continued.\nFORMER OHIO WOMAN\nRECEIVES WAR CROSS\nPARIS\u2014For nursing wounded at the\nfront since the beginning of the war,\nCountess Benoist d\u2019Azy, formerly of\nCincinnati, has received the war cross\nfrom the French government.\nThe countess has repeatedly worked\nat advance posts under Are.

I\nwill teach her to be bad or she will\nhave to leave the forest.\u201d\nOld Witch Badness called her black\ncat to her and put on her long black\ncloak and peaked high hat. Then she\nJumped on her broomstick and gave\nit a tap with her cane and off she\nsailed high up over the tall trees of\nthe forest. When she came to the\nplace where Bluebell lived she stopped\nand crept along the branches of the\ntree to the house where little Bluebell\nwas sleeping. Carefully she reached\nin the window with her long, lean arm\nand put a red apple on the bed beside\nher.\nWhen the Old Witch Badness\nreached her home she began.to dance\nabout and rub her lean, long hands\ntogether and laugh. \"Now, my pretty\nIn\nn %\nBluebell, you are mine!\u201d she said:\n\"You will eat the apple when you\nawake, I am sure, and then I shall\nhear no more of your goodness in this\nforest. You will be bad, as I am.\u201d\nThe next night she listened and still\nthe wind was whispering of the beauti\nful and good Bluebell to the trees.\nAgain the Witch Badness jumped\non her broomstick and flew to Blue\nbell's house at night. The fairies had\nturned the apple black and Bluebell\nhad not eaten it. This time the witch\ncarried a beautiful dress of silver and\ngold and placed it on the bed beside\nthe sleeping Bluebell.\nThis time the Old Witch Badness\nleft her black cat to watch the dress\nHeisler\u2019s Meat Market\n2514 LISBON AVENUE , I\nSPECIAL FOR SATURDAY\nPrime Beef Rib Roast, a pound Xfic\nBeef Pot Roast, a pound X6c\nPork Loin Roast, a pound 26c\nPork Shoulder, whole, a pound 24c\nFresh Dressed Spring Chicken, a pound. .23c\nFresh Dressed Stew Chicken, a pound... -22 c\nVeal at special prices.\nOur Home Made Blood and Liver Sausage\na Specialty.\nKost Gas Heaters 150 350\nOil Heaters.. 4.50, 5.50, 6^50\nKitchen Heaters 14.50, 16.00, 19.00\nCombination Ranges 50.00t\u00b0 90.00\nACORN STOVES AND RANGES\nFurnaces Installed and Repaired.\nGET OUR PRICES. \u2022\nWALNUT AND 3814 LISBON\n24TH STS.

What could he do there?\nI tell you. the bargain Included the\nsafety of Torrevo. The boy has gone\nback to Join Torrevo. and the 'Black\nCat' will sail for Buenos Ayres with\nthese two precious fellows on board.\"\n\u201cI will order horses. We can reach\nthe 'Black Cat' before morning. They\nwill not sail till then. We may even\novertake the boy.\"\nNow that his stupor was over. Elvin\ncould think and act quickly. Hs re\nalised the danger In which he and his\nson stood as long as this Intrepid and\nIntelligent young American was alive\nand at large. He ordered horses to be\nsaddled, and. after a drink to brace\ntheir nerves, father and son sat out on\ntheir errand\u2014two men. to run down\nand kill a boy.\nThere was a moon, and the way was\neasily made. The horses were put to\ntheir utmost, and mile after mile was\ncovered, but no Rob was seen.\nSuddenly Starne drew up and called\nto Elvin.\n\"BY JOVE. THAT'S TERREVO!\"\n\"Hist!\" he said. \"There Is a man\ncoming this way on foot.\"\nElvin reined In his horse and sat\nlooking In the direction Indicated by\nStarne.\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed. \"Thal's\nTorrevo!\"\nAnd Torrevo It was. making Ills way\non foot from the \"Black Cat\" to El\nvin's headquarters.\nCHAPTER XIV.\nElvin aud Starne rode toward him\nslowly.\n\"Be ready for treachery.\" said\nStarne. \"Have your pistol in your\nhand.

I thought\nyou Were to go to Montevideo.\"\n\"True. Captain Elvin.

What game? What do you\nmean?\"\nTomvo's black eyas glistened with\nsuspicion as he looked from one to the\n1 other. He readily saw that something\nunusual had happened. and from their\n' words he believed they bad discovered\nRob's identity and bls own duplicity.\n\"You know well enough what I\n1 mean. You are a traitor.\"\n\u201cThat Is what the Judge said when I\n' was convicted. That wua live years\n1 ago.\"\n\u201cYes, you were a traitor to your\nfriends then, and you are a traitor to\nyour friends now. Did you think you\ncould hoodwink us? I knew that boy\nwas Horton's nephew.\"\n1 \"So did I.\" said Torrevo. stolidly.\n\"But you told me.\" said Elvin, chok\ning with rage, and made worse by Tor-\n1 revo's cool teas; \"you told me that he ,\nwas your own nephew.\"\n\"Certainly\u2014and so he Is.\"\nBoth Elvin and Starne stood aghast 1\n'1 at this. This was the most monument\nal cheek they had ever seen.\n\u201cHe is Horton's nephew and mine\n\u2019 also,\" said Torrevo. as if It was a mat\nter of no Importance. \"You sec, cap-\n' tain. Horton's sister married my\nbrother.\"\n\"Liar!\u201d shouted Starne. \"Horton\nhad but one slater. She Is now In New\nYork, and her name Is Cleverdale.\"\n1 \u201cThat is true, also.\" said Torrevo.\nwith an Imperturbability that was\n\u2022 amaslng. \u201cShe married Senor Clever\n> dale after my brother died.\"\n\"But this boy's nanc Is Cleverdale.\"\n1 \"Yes. they gave him that.

Starne w\u201e -till In the saddle,\nand all Torrevo could do was to slash\nal his legs. Starne aimed and sent a\nbullet Into Torrevo heart.\"\n\"One traitor less, he said, calmly,\nns Torrevo fell on 'lie ground dead.\n\"What a glorious Hat that fellow was.\nHe Would have leu worth something\nIf ho could have le< 11 trusted.\"\n\"But we ate In a hm* hx!\" said Elvin.\n\"The 'Blaik Cat \u00abis due at Monte\nvideo lu two days '\" bring over Gen\neral Quesada.

Starne going\non foot toward Black Cat Bay. and KI- !\nvin returning to his headquarters,\nleading Lemuel's horse.\nBut where was Rob Cleverdale. 1\nwhile Elvin. Starne and Torrevo were\nlooking for him In vain?\nHe was on his way to the \"Black '\nCat,\" as Starne suspected, but. being\nIgnorant of the road, ho had gone a\nlittle out of his way, and thus missed\nTorrevo.\nEarly In the evening, when Elvin '\nI thought ho had gone to lu-d. the cour- 1\nageoiis young American had slipped\nout of the window, which was not\nI more than Hvo feet from the ground.\n| and had fortunately chosen 11 moment\n\u0964 when there wns no one around to see\nI him. Elndlng all dear, he had shaped 1\n! his course as well as he knew how.\n] for Black Cat Bay. and started off on\na run. He kept up this gait for some\ntime and then rested. There was no\nsight of pursuers, so he trudged on\nagain, keeping the direction, as he\nthought, straight to the river. Bui he\ndid not navel as straight aa hr\nthought he did. He made quite a de\ntour to the north, thus missing Tor\nrevo. but toward morning reached the\nriver a short distance above the bay.\nThere was an island, quite a moun\ntain. out in the river, which could\nlie seen from ths entrance to Black\nCal Bay. and Rob could see It from\nthe point where lie met the river. From\nits position he knew he was too high\nup. and went down toward the anchor\nage.\n(To lw> continued. 1\nThe Tiger Ost.\nNo circus menagerie Is ever with- |\nout Its man-eater, you know.\" said the\nold wagon driver as reminiscences\nwere lu order. \"We had ours when I\nwas with Dan Rice, and the papers\ngave him such an awful reputation for\nferocity that people dared not to mme\nwithin ten feet of his cage.

It was\nto the Hermitage many long years ago,\nwhen the country was in Its youth, that\ntheir papa, a highly respectable trades\nman in the Edgeware road, had brought\nhome his young wife, and to the Hermit\nage he had retired, when, a few years\nlater, having amassed a comfortable little\ncompetency, he sold his business and de\nvoted himself to the pleasures of country\nlife\u2014as country life suggested itself to\nthe limited views of a born cockney. He\nloved ids garden, though he didn't know\nthe name of anything that grew in it.\nlie kept a dog, whose principal amusement\nwas getting into all the mud it could And,\nand then jumping up at his master and\nputting a dirty paw upon his coat or his\nwaistcoat. Until he kept a dog, Mr, Shoo\nemith had been In the habit of disporting\nhimself for eight months in the year in\nnankeen trousers and h white waistoat,\nbut when it became a question of the nan\nkeen trousers and white waistcoat or the\ndog, both together being impossible, he\nsacrificed his personal appearance to his\nlove for his canine companion. He wore\ndark trousers and a dark waistcoat, and\nthe marks of esteem lavished on his habila\nments by Bruno, the brown retriever,\nbecame a less costly Item in his washing\nbill.

He lived for the next week in\n\u25a0 the strict retirement of the back parlor,\n\u25a0 with various soothing unguents on his face\n\u25a0 and head and neck.\n\u25a0 The Misses Shoosmith had Inherited\n\u25a0 from their papa a comfortable competence\n\u25a0 and a love of domestic animals, and frtam\n\u25a0 their mamma a knowledge of domestic\n\u25a0 horticulture, a light hand at pastry, and\n\u25a0 much cunning with herbs, simples and\n\u25a0 the preparation of home-made wines and\n\u25a0 sundry beverages of a mildly alcoholic\n\u25a0 character.\n\u25a0 The cowslip wine and the rhubarb wine\n\u25a0of The Hermitage were household words\n\u25a0 among the select circle of acquaintance\n\u25a0in Hendon, and their elderberry wine,\n\u25a0 taken hot on a winter's night was de\n\u25a0 clarel by the Rev.

Mr. Jones, the curate\n(who had specially enlisted them under\nhis banner for his Dorcas society, his\nMothers\u2019 Meetings, his Little Helpers\u2019\nLeague, his Coal and Blanket Fund, and\nhis Cottage Mission), could shake their\nfaith in the simple forms of superstition\nin which they had been reared.\nThe Rev. Mr. Jones was a bachelor of\nforty, pale and lean, not because he will\ningly denied himself the good things of\nthis life, but because until he came to take\ncharge of his present parish he had re\nceived such a miserable stipend that when\nhe had paid his rent and sent his mother\na small weekly allowance there was not\nsufficient left for him to make good red\nblood with and to grow fat on. He had\npractically starved himself for twenty\nyears and now that he had fallen among\nhospital, well-to-do people it was too late\nfor him to repair the ravages of the past.\nOne winter\u2019s evening, after a hard day\u2019s\nwork preparing for the distribution of the\nChristmas charities, in which he had been\nlargely assisted by Deborah and Jane\nShoosmith, the Rev. Mr. Jones, who had\ncalled as he was passing by, and had had\na large glass of the delightful elderberry\nwine specially mulled for him on the par\nlor fire, found himself so comfortable\nin the easy chair and felt his nerves so\nsoothed by the amiable chatter of the old\nladies that he yielded to their pressing so\nlicitations and stayed to supper.\nThe temptation on this occasion was\ngreat, for Miss Deborah, who had inform\ned him that she was then baking in the\noven for their evening meal some Span\nish onions, and if there was one thing that\nthe Rev. Mr. Jones had a special weakness\nfor it was a baked Spanish onion. There\nare very few people who know how to\nprepare a Spanish onion, which, perfectly\ncooked, is a delicacy for a monarch,. To\nboil a Spanish onion is an atrocity The\nproper way is to put it in the oven and\nlet it bake slowly for some hours, and\nwhen it is cooked to take it out all hot\nand fragrant, and prepare it with butter\nand pepper and salt, and then I know\nnothing that bounteous nature has given\nto man for food that can compare with it.\nEven as I write there comes back to me\nthe memory of a Spanish onion a dear old\nlady cooked for me over twenty years ago\nin an old farmhouse in Northumberland.\nI have never tasted anything like it since.\nI have, in wild moments of despair, or\ndered Spanish onions at big hotels in vari\nous parts of England, and endeavored to\nimpress upon the waiter the necessity of\na slow and careful baking, but the result\nhas always been a bitter disappointment.\nThe Spanish onion of the old Northum\nberland farm still stands out in my mem\nory a thing distinct, unapproached, and,\nalas, it seems to me now, unapproacha\nble. \\\nThe Rev. Mr. Jones found not only the\nbaked Spanish onion excellent, but the\ncold beef delicious, and the horseradish\nsauce, specially prepared with cream by\nMiss Jane, almost sinful, by reason of the\nintense gratification it afforded his palate.\nAnd after the supper the good old ladles\nbegged him to smoke the pipe which they\nknew he carried in his pocket, and he sat\nback, satisfied and slightly sleepy in the\neasy chair and puffed his evening cloud,\nand felt he was beginning to enjoy life for\nthe first time.\nHe was sitting with half-closed eyes\nlistening dreamily to the soothing chatter\nof the old maids and replying* in conve\nnient monosyllables, when he felt some\nthing warm suddenly depositing itself\nupon his knees, and opening his eyes he\nfound that a large black cat had confid\ningly curled itself up in his apology for a\nlap.\n\u201cOh, Peter, how dare you!\u201d exclaimed\nMiss Deborah, and she came across to\nremove the intruder.\nBut the Rev. Mr. Jones smiled and held\nup his hand deprecatingly.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t incommode me in the slight\nest,\u201d he said; \u201cin fact, I rather like it.\u201d\nThen he began to stroke the black cat\ngently, and the black eat began to purr\nand to go through a process which the\nchildren call sometimes \u201ckneading dough\u201d\nand sometimes \u201cspinning money;\u201d but\nwhen a cat \u201cspins money\u201d It spreads its\npaws out flat, and digs its claws into any\nthing that may be handy, in the process.\n\u201cOh. I\u2019m sure Peter will worry you\u2014\nplease let me take him,\u201d said Miss Debo\nrah.\n\u201cNot at all\u2014not at all,\u201d replied the Rev.\nMr. Jones. \u201cI\u2019m used to cats\u2014l\u2019m very\nfond of them. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever\nseen this one here before, have I? What\na beautiful Jet black it is.\u201d\n\u201cIt only came into the house yesterday,\u201d\nsaid Miss Janet. \u201cIt was a stray cat evi\ndently, but we couldn\u2019t turn It out be\ncause, you know, a black cat coming into\nthe house is so lucky, and if you send it\naway you send your good luck away with\nIt.\u201d\nThe Rev. Mr. Jones smiled.\n\u201cMy dear Miss Shoosmith,\u201d he said,\n\u201cyou really must not talk like that. I\ncannot imagine that you really believe\nthat what you call \u2019luck\u2019 is dependent\nupon the coming or going of an animal.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but indeed it is,\u201d answered Miss\nDeborah. \u201cOur mother had a black cat\u2014\nwe have called this one Peter after It\u2014\nand it came Into the house the very day\nour dear father received the largest order\nhe ever had ln his life, and the day after\nIt disappeared mamma was coming home\nfrom town In a hired brougham late at\nnight, and wanting to tell the coachman\nnot to whip his horse so cruelly, she went\nto put her head out of the window, not\nknowing that the window was up, and cut\nher face dreadfully.\u201d\nThe Rev. Mr. Jones lifted his hands in\nholy horror.\n\"My dear ladies!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthis\nIs very dreadful. Such superstitions as\nthese belong to the dark ages\u2014they belong\nto Paganism rather than to Christianity.\nYou will tell me presently that black cats\nare the \u2019familiars\u2019 of witches\u2014perhaps\nthat they are witches or demons them\nselves, who have assumed the shape of\nanimals.\u201d\nMiss Jane ahook her head. \"I won\u2019t say\nI quite believe that.\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\nhave heard our dear mamma tell a story\nof a black cat who was found in a cottage\nwhere a witch . had lived, and the old\nwoman was never seen again, and It was\nalways said ln the village that the witch\nhad assumed that shape.\u201d\n\"My dear ladles!\u201d cried the reverend\ngentleman, \u201cam l Hitting in the parlor of\nSAVANNAH, GA.. SUNDAY. JANUARY 3. 1897.\ntwo of my most devout Christian work\ners, and is this the ninteenth century?\nBlack cats are like ordinary cats\u2014they\npossess no extraordinary powers!\u201d\n\u201cOh, but thev do!\" urged Miss Deborah.\n\u201cA black cat is always strange in its ways\nand habits\u2014sparks come out of Its back\nsometimes, and it understands everything\nthat is said to it.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense! Do you mean to say that if\nI said to Peter, \u2019Peter, stand on your\nhead!\u2019 he wduld\u2014\u201d\nThe reverend gentleman suddenly stop\nped, and gave a great gasp, and the Misses\nShoosmith sprang back and hugged each\nother, trembling, in a corner.\nPeter, the black cat, had suddenly leapt\nfrom the clergyman's knee on to the table,\nand was standing on. his head!\nThe reverend gentleman stared ln horror\nat the animal who had obeyed his behest.\nGreat beads of perspiration broke out sud\ndenly upon his brow. The situation was\nabsolutely paralyzing.\n\u201cOh, Mr. Jones!\u201d groaned the unhappy\nold ladies, \u201csay something\u2014do some\nthing!\u201d\nNeither Miss Deborah nor Miss Jane\nknew exactly what they expected the be\nwildered curate to do. It would be against\nhis principles to indulge in any cabalistic\nwords, or to make the sign of the Cross\nto a dumb animal, and there was no form\nof prayer known to the modern Christian\nchurch which could be considered spe\ncially suitable for the occasion.\nBut the cat settled the difficulty. Hav\ning remained on his head for nearly a\nminute, he fell over on to his side, and\nthen jumped back into the easy chair and\ncurled himself up as calmly as though he\nhad done nothing out of the ordinary rou\ntine of a respectable cat\u2019s dally life.\nThen the reverend gentleman held out\nhis hand, and said he thought it was time\nfor him to go home. He begged the good\nladies to dismiss from their minds any\nidea that the eat had really stood upon\nits head. They were the victims of their\nown imagination\u2014all three of them. They\nhad been talking about an occurrence of\nthat sort, and Peter had, by a curious\ncoincidence, at that very moment jumped\non the table, and assumed an attitude ac\ncidentally which they had mistaken for\nstanding on his head.\nThe sisters begged Mr. Jones to stay un\ntil they had decided what to do with the\ncat. Under the circumstances, they felt\nthat the presence of a clergyman was at\nleast a protection against the powers of\nevil. They would be satisfied if he would\nonly stay till midnight, which was the\nhour they dreaded, not knowing what Its\neffect might be upon Peter.\nBut the reverend gentleman wouldn\u2019t\nhear of such a thing. There was nothing\nin midnight, and there was nothing in\nblack cats, and he refused to encourage\nby any acquiescence in his hostesses\u2019\nwishes such abominable and heathenish\nsuperstition.\nHe bade the old ladles good night once\nmore, put on his hat and his Inverness\ncape, and went down the gravel path\ntrembling in every limb.\nAnd at every sound that he heard that\nnight as he made his lonely way to his\nresidence, he gave a little jump and went\nhot and cold all over.\nHe had seen a black cat stand on its\nhead with his own eyes, and that it should\nstand on its head had been the test he\nhad applied to prove that black cats nave\nno supernatural qualities.\nWhen the curate has gone and the Misses\nShoosmith were left alone with Peter, they\nlooked at each other with white faces and\ntrembling lips, each sister silently seek\ning advice from the other. Miss De\nborah was the first to make a decided at\ntack on the enemy. She went across the\nroom to the bookcase, took out the family\nBible, and placed it solemnly on the table.\nThen she addressed Peter, who by this\ntime was fast asleep, in these words:\n\u201cPeter, if you are an evil spirit you will\nnot harm us, for we have never harmed\nanyone in our lives. If you choose to re\nmain with us we will give you new milk\nand fresh fish, and endeavor to make you\nhappy, but if you would go away in the\nnight we should be very much obliged to\nyou.\u201d\nThen turning out the gas she beckoned\nto her sister, and they went out of the\nroom, and locking the door quickly behind\nthem they went up-stairs to bed, and\nburnt a night-light and slept with their\nheads under the clothes.\nWhen they awoke In the morning the\nsun was shining in at their windows, and\nin the sunlight they felt Inclined to laugh\nat the terrors of the previous night. After\nall, the Rev. Mr. Jones was probably right\n\u2014their senses had been deceived. Peter\nhadn\u2019t really stood on his head at all.\nThey went downstairs, and to their In\ntense relief there was no Peter. The maid\nservant Informed them that when she\nopened the door the cat had slipped \nher into the garden.\nAt noon walking in the garden they came\nsuddenly on Peter under a currant bush.\nHe rose, arched his bank, rubbed up\nagainst them and purred, and they stroked\nhim, and said complimentary things to\nhim. There were some birds on the cher\nry tree picking at the ripe cherries. Miss\nDeborah clapped her hands three times to\nfrighten them away.\nInstantly Peter ran up Miss Deborah's\nback, jumped on to her bare head, and\nstood bolt upright on his hind legs.\nMiss Jane fainted dead away, and Miss\nDeborah shrieking ran round and round\nthe garden. But Peter stood his ground\nfirmly. At that moment the Rev. Mr.\nJones came up the garden to enquire how\nthey were after the fright of the previous\nevening. When he saw Miss Deborah\nrushing about with the black cat standing\non its hind legs on her head he stammered\nout a trivial excuse and fled. He felt con\nvinced that insanity of some kind or other\nhad suddenly made Its appearance in that\nhitherto happy little Christian household,\nand that in some mysterious way his own\nmental balance had been overthrown in\nsympathy.\nWhen Miss Jane recovered from her\nfaint she found Miss Deborah sobbing hys\nterkally in a garden chair.\nThe cat was no longer on her head In\nan acrobatic attitude. It had Jumped down\nand gone back to lie under the currant\nbush. ,\n\"Oh, Jane!\u201d sobbed the unhappy old\nlady, \u201cI know what it means now. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthat wicked gipsy woman who came beg\nging last Tuesday. I told her to go about\nher business, and she was insolent and\nsaid I was a hard-hearted wretch, and\nshe'd put the black curse on me\u2014and she's\ndone It\u2014Peter Is the black curse!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Miss Jane, \u2019Oh, my\ndear sister, it Is a terrible thing to happen\nto us ln our old age. but we must bear It\npatiently\u2014and whatever we do, we must\nnot ofTend Peter. So long as we treat him\nkindly and don't attempt to injure him or\nto restrict his liberty he may not do any\nthing to Injure us.\u201d\n\"Jane!\u201d whispered Mis 9 Deborah, terri\nfied at her own thought, \u2018do you think it\nwould be very wicked of us\u2014lf we were\nto send for a little holy water.

They\npresented him with a red satin ribbon for\nhis neck, and they periodically filled his\nsaucer with milk fresh from the cow.\nThey seriously discussed the advisability\nof giving him cream. They procurred fish\nfor him daily, taking care that an agree\nable variety was maintained. One day\nthe principal item on Peter\u2019s menu would\nhe smelts, the next sole, the next had\ndock, and so on, and when Miss Deborah\nsuggested a bloater Miss Janes objected\nthat Peter might consider himself slight\ned by the plebian nature of the fare.\nThey were intensely relieved to find that\nPeter, becoming fat and lazy on his liberal\ndiet, abstained from all further demon\nstrations of an unfeline character. They\nhad a strong suspicion that the threat\nof holy water had made a deep impression\non him and caused him to be cautious as\nto his future conduct.\nBut one fine afternoon all their terrors\nwere revived. The maid was out on the\nback lawn hanging out the clothes to dry.\nThe line, discreetly veiled from observa\ntion by the high wall and the trees, was\nstretched tightly from clothes prop to\nclothes prop, and the maid was Just about\nto peg up the first snowy sheet when Peter\nsuddenly ran up a clothes prop and stood\non his hind legs, and then proceeded to\nwalk across the rope with all the ak 11 of\na Blondln and without a balancing pole.\nThe maid dropped the linen on the\nground to Us utter undoing, and rushed\nscreaming Into the house. \u201dOh, Missis!\nMissis!\u201d she shrieked, as she met Miss\nDeborah at the back door, \"Peter\u2019s be\nwitched. He\u2019s a walkin\u2019 like as If he was\ngoing mad!\u201d\nMiss Deborah, trembling at the knees\nlike an aged cab-horse after the ascent of\nHighgate Hill, staggered out, and there,\nsure enough, was Pter behaving as surely\nno cat ln a Christian country had ever be\nhaved before.\nWhen he saw Miss Deborah he uttered\na wild yell and dropped to the ground.\nThen he ran toward her, and, raising him\nself up on his hind legs, sparred at her\nwith his front paws, like wicked little boys\nspar at a comrade when they invite him\nto come on and have It out.\nThat was too much for Miss Deborah.\nShe gathered up her skirts and fled back\ninto the house, 'eavlng Peter In undisputed\npossession of all he could survey.\nThat evening the sisters determined that\nthey would fulfil a long-deferred promise,\nand pay a visit to a distant relative of\ntheir mother\u2019s who lived ln London. They\nknew that they would be welcome guests\nfor at least a fortnight, and It was possi\nble that, during their absence, the curse\nwould be withdrawn from their home, and\nPeter, having nobody to practice hla evil\n250 Men\u2019s Suits that we will close at\n$4.68.

He didn't\nknow what peculiar manifestations of fe\nline eccentricity Peter might Indulge in for\nhis benefit, and he preferred that sort of\nthing in the daylight. After nightfall, it\nhad a more painful effect on the nerves.\nPunctually at 3:30, which had been the\ntea hour of the Misses Shoosmith as long\nas they could remember, the Rev. Mr.\nJones arrived at the Hermitage. But he\nwas in a state of quite unusual excitement.\nHo had been to the reading room of the lo\ncal Mechanics\u2019 Institute, and there he had\nseen, quite by accident, an advertisement\nIn the Daily Telegraph. He had borrowed\nthe paper and brought it with him. This\nwas the advertisement he read aloud to\nhis hospitable hostesses.\n\"Lost, on the 10th of March, a large\nblack cat.

The child was,\nthen, as nearly as could be guessed, abouc\n3 years old. She was dressed in a dirty]\nred Jacket, trimmed with lace and shin\ning buttons, like the typical hand-organ\nmonkey. Her diminutive body, moreover,\nhad been squeezed into the skin of a real\nmonkey. It fitted down closely over th\u00ae\nentire face, leaving only openings for tha\nmouth and nostrils, and two holes sur\nrounded by hair, through which a pair of\neyes peered. Originally, the monkey skin\nhad been made to cover the hands and\nfeet, but had worn away, leaving the tiny]\nmembers bare, save for the thickly-en\ncrusted filth and dirt that covered them\nalmost beyond recognition. The monkey\nskin upon her body had become worn\nbare in spots, and, besides, was moth\neaten, and had been dingily patched, but\nthe ape-ltke tricks which the child had\nbeen beaten Into acquiring readily divert\ned attention from these defects.\nShe could climb a table leg as nimbly\nas any monkey ever exhibited, and thera\nwas a contrivance by which she could\nmove the tall that was attached to tha\nmonkey skin she wore. It was dreadfully\nfatiguing work for the withered little mid\nget to move this tall, and out of all tha\nhorrors of her life, the memory of tha\nhalf-fainting efforts to do this still coma\nback to her as among the most vivid of\nher child memories. The estimable parent\nwho maintained his valuable existence by\nthus exhibiting his offspring had to starva\nher, and had fed her on gin from child\nhood In order to repress her unflllal ten\ndency to outgrow her monkey skin; and\nhe knew that this could not go on for\never without killing her. go he was try\ning to get as much out of her as he could\nwhile she lasted.\nDuring the summer the father and hi#\ngirl-monkey tramped it alone, and onca\nIn a while, by way of variety, the father\nlet her out of the monkey skin and sent\nher begging from house to house, with\ninstructions to steal whatever she could\nlay her hands on.

Ashby of this city hits tohl j\nof some interf.stin rxptrlfiH-os that j\nhe had in Civil war times a.s a con- i\nfederate prisoner. Mr. Ashby was I\nborn in England and came to the xtau- ;\nof New l ork when a boy of .six. It\nrequired pewrii weeks for the boat to\noross the Atlantic. The trip was\nmade in October and Mr. Ahby ate\nlaia sixth birthday dinner on board the\nressel. The only thing that he re\nmembers of having for the dinner w;i.s\na good large piece of cake which he\nhad brought from England. This was\nan unusual delicacy.\nMr. Ash by enlisted in the Slh Xew\nTork Heavy Artillery on July 2. I s tj 3 . ,\nWhen he and his companions went in- i\nto the service, however, they went as\ninfantry. Charles was under nineteen !\nyears of age by four months. The i\nfirst place the regiment went to was j\nSpott-sylvania. Other points where!\nthe regiment saw service were Straw\nberry l'lains. Deep Iiottom, l'eters-\nburg. Jerusalem Plank Road, Hello ',\nPlains Landing (where Mr. Ashby was '\nkept as a nurse for three weeks) Wei\ndon P.oads, Norrfi Anna, ToMpotomy,\nCold Harbor, and Ream Station.\nWhile Mr. Ashby was at P.elle Mains\nLanding his regiment pa.s-.ed by him\nAnd went to guard a 33.000 wagon\ntrain.\nWhile in one of these battles Mr.\nAshby with about 9000 othe'r soldiers\nwas taken prisoner and sent to Castle\nSunday on the outskirts of Richmond,\nVirginia. This was a distributing sta\ntion and the prisoners were sent to the\nconfederate prisons from there. Mr.\nAshby was committed to Lib by Prison.\nFrom there he was later, s nt to lb lle\nIsle for a few weeks and then taken\nto Salisbury where he was confined for\nfour months. At the expiration of;\nthis time Sherman came\" within thirty\niiiil -s ,f the prist. n and theconfi-di-r-ate\noflicers opened the gates of the\nprison and told the prisoners to tiee\nup the railroad tracks. Many of them\nwent out. as it meant liberty, hut' hun\ndreds of them were so weak that they\ncould not walk, Mr. Ashby was one\nof the number that remained. Dur\ning the four months while Mr. Ashby\nwas in Salisbury 10.000 men had been\ncommitted to the prison but b sh than\nWhile in Salisbury prison Mr. As h\nf,000 were left at the end of the period,\nby had some trying experiences, lie\ntells nome of the following: The men\nlived in small caves in the ground.\nThey were built by digging holes in\nthe ground like cisterns. The dirt\ni\nwas piled up around the edge of the\nhole to form a natural drain away\nfroni the opening so that the water\nwould run off in times of rain. A\nblanket was stretched over the top to\nkeep out the storms. An many men\nas could huddle into a hole would\ncrowd together at night and if any of\n1 them chanced to have a blanket to\ni spread over the w hole number they\n'considered themselves very fortunate.\nThe prison had formerly been a\nj c otton factory. Several buildings sur-\nrounded it and all lf these were en\n; closed In a high Htoekade, made by\n; planting trees slanting inward about\nI twenty feet in height all around the\nI buildings. The trees were sharpened\n'on the top ends. On one side of the\nprison was a river. A portion of it\ni ran through the coiner of the prison\nj stockade, and the men were dermitted\n; to wash their clothes in the waters of\n.the river. They were also required toT\n! drink the water from the same stream,\ni Resides, it was used us the Common\nsewer for the whole prison.\nI The men were fed bacon and soup\ni once a day. They were divided into\n! squads of tifty each and their rations\nJ were distributed to tin m by a prison\n' otlicial. The bacon wa.s brought into\nthe squad after it hail been cooked in\nthe bean or rice soup. It was laid on\na blanket and divided into Jifty pieces,\neach of which wa.s about an inch and\nla half, square. The oilicer would\nj select one of the number to assist him\n' in dividing the meat ho that everyone\n: would have an equal chance of secur\ning the- best pieces. The others were\n! all compelled to turn their backs and\nj the chosen comrade would parcel out\n(the pieces to his companions. This\nj meat together with a half a cup of\nbean soup, was the ration for the day.\nThe best dinner that Mr. Ashby' had\n, while in the prison was the day an old\n! mule was cooked. The officers claim\ned it was a cow but the men investi\ngated the skull and found that there\nwere front teeth in both the upper\nand lower jaws, and this discovery\ni gave the fact of its being a rnule away.\n! When the carcass was cooked a par\nticular friend of Mr. Asb.\"' Med\nto be selected \"\nthe day. Wh\neye he e;.\"'\nI All tlo\nconsent as\nj being the\nany of the\n; the most n\nanimal and\ni ful for the\nwith the aid ofome of hU fellows.\nHe dug a hole down near the edge of\nthe river, and in fact within the\nKwampy bank themselves. The dirt\nv.as carefully distributed on the tops\nof t'ae little cistern holes within the\nprison so that the otllcers would not\ndetect the man's intentions. He then\nclimbed Into the wet hole anl had his\ncompanions cover him with dirt and\nwaterweeds. He intended, when night\ncame, to dive, out under the. stockade\nand swim the river. Almost im\nmediately across from I he stockade\nwas an Island. Around its banks\nwere chained hungry bloodhounds.\nShould a man attempt to swim the\nrivt r the hounds would swim after\nhim and if the man came within. their\nreach the dogs would have n good\ndinner. The man who expe'eted to\ne.'caped pondered in his mind all day\nthoughts of being eaten by the blood\nhounds ami concluded that if he\nshould chance to drift close enough\nto the hounds the attempt would even\nthen be worth the hazard.\nThe olllcera called the roll every\nmorning and on this particular morn\ning they missed the man who had\nbeen secreted away. Diligent search\nwas made but they could not find him.\nAs it was Hearing night the otllcers\nwttit to the water's edge and after\nprobing around in the weeds a few\nminutes found the prisoner, lief ore\nthey secured him in chains tho man\nsnapped a revolver in thefr faces live\ntimes. The shells were so wt, how\never, that they would not explode and\nthe man was taken.\nOnly a few minutes after the cap-.J\nture one of the prisoners appeared j\nwith two loaves of bread. He had\nbetrayed his fellow prisoner in the\nhole for the bread. The betrayer did '\nnot leave the prison that night, but\nthe next morning mt a sign of him j\ncould Le fojnd. Even his bones were,\nI so completely secreted away that they j\nwere never liMinii. jnc prisoners;\nwire confident that the man had been 1\neaten by the friends of the man who j\nexpected to escape. r\nMr. Ashby has lived in Holding and 1\nOrleans township for the past 3S j\nyears. Most of that time he owned j\na farm on the south., hank of \"Long;\nLake. He sold the farm twelve years\nago to VY. 1 Pricker and took pro- ;\nperty in Holding in on the deal. While '\non the farm he brought the land up i\nto such a high s-tnte of cultivation that j\nit would produce 135 bushels of corn\nper acre.\nMr. Ashby has several dishes that j\nare over a century old owned by his i\ngfeat-great-grandparents.

BROGAN\nWind and storm \u2019\u2022attled at the win\ndown of Philip Duncombe\u2019s apartment\nwhile That young man settled back in\nhis chair with a weary sigh. The few\nweeks\u2019 imprisonment an illness had im\nposed left him in an unenviable state\nof discontent. Magazines and books of\nalluring titles failed to amuse.\n\"Inane!\" exclaimed Philip and tossed\nthe last one to the floor. The tele\nphone's imperative call came as a re\nlief from his own gloomy meditation.\n\"Hello!\" cried a hearty voice. \"Thitt\nyou, Phil? What about the illustration\ncalled \u2019Home?\u2019 We\u2019re waiting for it,\nyou know. Cnn\u2019t you rush the thing\noff? Just a young man and woman\nseated before an open Are. cat curled\nup in the foreground, or something like\nthat. Get the idea? Of course we\nknow you've been sick, but\u201d\u2014\n\u201cIt has not been Illness alone which\nkept me back.\u201d Philip replied. \u201cTruth\nis 1 can't find a suitable girl\u2019s face for\nthe picture.\u201d\nBrown chuckled over the phone.\n\"Temperament,\u201d he said derisively.\nPhilip went back ruminating to his\nchair beside the fire.\n\"What do I desire to make me hap\npy?\u201d he mused bitterly. \u201cMoney\nenough for all reasonable purposes,\nfame\u2014more than I deserve\u2014friends\nwho tire me.\u201d He bent forward, gaz\ning . steadily into the glowing coals.\nFaintly from without came a tiny muf\nfled cry. and as Philip stopped to lis\nten the cry was repeated with loudfer\npersistency. Following the direction\nof the sound, Philip drew aside a cur\ntain. There upon the outer sill hud\ndled a small furry creature whose gold\nen eyes begged piteously for shelter.\n\u201cBy Jove!\u201d cried Philip Duucombe\nand raised the window. With a mew\nof gratitude the little black cat sprang\ninto the room. Philip looked quickly\nalong the smooth side of the building\nand down the seven straight stories to\nthe street. \u201cBy Jove!\u201d he ejacnlnted\nagain. The little cat vouchsafed no\nexplanation. It was calmly engaged\nin grooming Its wet fur in the grateful\nwarmth of the fire. That delicate oper\nation accomplished, the cat climbed con\nfidingly to the arm of Philip\u2019s chair.\n\u201cYou queer little beggar!\u201d Philip\nlaughed under his breath and put forth\nhis haud to pat the cat\u2019s head, but in\nquick defense a black paw was un\nsheathed to parry an expected blow.\nThe Japanese servant glided in-curi\nously at the unexpected sound of Phil\nip\u2019s laughter. His black eyes were\nround and beadlike. \"The cat!\u201d he ex\nclaimed. \u201cHow does it come here?\"\n\u201cDropped from the clouds,\u201d Philip\ntold him. \u201cBut we shall keep him to\nsketch. See that the cat does not es\ncape, Tenuo.\u201d\n\u201cI will watch.\u201d he suid, and Philip,\ntaken off guard at this moment, receiv\ned a well aimed scratch.\n\u201cThat will do for you. Jack Johnson,\"\nhe remarked. \u201cYou have proved your\npugilistic ability.\u201d The longer Philip\nkept the cat the more he became at\nTHE CAT CLIMBED CONFIDINGLY TO THE\nARM OF PHILIP\u2019S CHAIR.\ntached to *tlie plucky, comforting little\ncreature. He sent the Japanese to\npurchdse a collar for his pet.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t risk losing him while we\nare sketching,\u201d he explained, so see\nthat \u2018Suit 44, Lexon Apartments.\u2019 is\nengraved upon the plate.\u201d\n\u201cWish your name also?\u201d inquired\nTenno. Philip shook his- head. \u201cYou\nmight,\u201d be added humorously, \"have\nhis own name inscribed\u2014Jack John\nson.\u201d And the very night that the col\nlar was carefully adjusted the black\neat disappeared. Protestingiy Tenno\ndeclared his vigilance:\n\u201cI close all doors.\u201d he insisted. Phil\nip was disgustedly, destroying his latest\nsketch upon the following morning\nwhen the Japanese accosted him excit\nedly. \u201cLady will see you, sir,\u201d he whis\npered. \u201cI tell her you are engaged, but\nshe says\u201d\u2014\n\u201cThat I will detain you but a few\nmoments,\" called a clear, girlish voice.\nand a young woman advanced Into the\nroom.\n\u201cI came.\u201d she announced, \u201cabout my\ncat. My maid tells me that you have\nbeen willfully harboring it. She has\nactually been obliged to tight for its\nownership with your stupidly stubborn\nservant.\u201d The girl caught her breath\nwrnthfully. \"But\u2014but last night was\nthe limit of impertinence. Wasn't it\nenough to keep my cat looked here for\ndays without Inscribing your address\nupon her collar?\u201d\n\u201cI assure you.\" Philip began humbly,\n\"that I have made no effort to entice\nyour pet. She dropped, as it were,\nfrom out of a clear sky. I found her\none evening 'tapping, gently tapping,\nat my frosted windowpnne.\u2019 \u201d\nThe girl glanced toward the window\ncontemptuously. \u201cIf you persist in\ntreating the matter as a joke,\u201d she re\nmarked with dignity: then her eyes\nwidened in childish wonder.\n\u201cLook there!\" she cried. Upon the\nouter sill, eight Stories high above the\nstreet, clung a small furry ball. \"Why\n\u2014why, she must have crept out of our\nroof window.\" said the girl, \"and on\ndown that narrow ledge.\u201d\nAs before. Philip cautiously raised\nthe sash, while the black cat made Its\nway to the hearth rug, there to sit\nblinking wickedly bnek at them both.\nShe came presently to nestle ngainst\nPhilip\u2019s shoulder, raising her paw to\ndeal a playful blow.\n\u201cOh,\" she breathed. \u201cOh! So it was\nyou also who taught her that!\"\nThe girl took the cat and moved to\nward the doorway. There she paused.\n\u201cWe will return the collar with its\natrocious name.\" she said, and a mis\nchievous smile flashed over her face.\nPhilip followed the graceful figure\nto the vestibule. \"Jack Johnson seem\ned\" a fitting name to me.\u201d he replied.\n\u201cWould you mind telling the real one?\u201d\nFor a moment the gill hesitated, her\nhand upon the knob: then she looked\nback with dancing eyes. \"The little\ncat's real name.\u201d she repented delib\nerately, \u201cis Lady Lillian.\u201d\nPhilip sat long before the Are that\nnight in pleasant reverie, and during\nthe days which followed he seemed\npossessed of a feverish spirit of unrest.\n\u201cDo you know.\u201d he asked of Teuno,\n\u201cthe name of the lady who owns our\ncat?\u201d And Tenno shook his head.\n\u201cNot the name.\" lie answered regret -\n\u25a0fully, \u201cbut the number of her apart\nment is 52. It is there that I dispute\nwith the maid.\"\nThen with an inspiration bcrn of dull\nand lagging hours Philip drew toward\nhim pen and paper. \u201cTo the Lady Lil\nlian, suit 52.\u201d he scribbled; then wrote:\n\u201cMy abject remorse impels me to\nfurther apology for detaining you from\nthe presence of your mistress, but if\nshe could for oue moment appreciate\nthe utter, desperate loneliness of a\nbachelor's convalescence she would, I\nam sure, not only pardon his late of\nfense, but would still lend you to him\noccasionally to divert\u2014and to sketch.\nThere are times when oue can be grate\nful for the affection of\u2014even a small\nblack cat.\u201d\nPhilip smiled whimsically as he bold\nly signed his name, and when the note\nhad been dispatched he marveled at\nthe eager impatience with which be\nawaited a reply. He anticipated Ten\nno in nnswering the bell next morning,\nand there, sure enough, in the corri\ndor stood the girl with the cat in bei\narms.\n\u201cWe did not know you had been ill,\u2019\nsaid the girl gently, \u201cor that so popular\nan artist could be\u2014lonely. We\u201d\u2014she\nhesitated In pretty diffidence\u2014\u201cwe wert\nrather rude the other day and are anx\nious tt> make amends. Ludy Lillian\nshall come whenever you wish, and I\nwill call to take her home. She is hon\nored, 1 am sure, to be the subject of a\nsketch.\u201d And before Philip could\nstammer out his thanks the girl hur\nried down the hall. In an Inexplicably\nhappy mood he carried the black cat\ninto the house, while those tenderly\nsympathetic eyes seemed still shining\ninto his own. And every morning\nthereafter Philip listened with painful\nintensity for the ringing of the bell,\nwhile the few words exchanged In the\ncorridor, a memory of a sweet upraised\nface changed the routine of \u201cexist\nence\u201d Into a real joyous \"living.\u201d\n\u201cYou feel much better, sir, Mr. Dun\ncombe?\u201d the faithful servnnt asked.\n\u201cBetter,\u201d he cried, \u201cbetter! I am go\nlng to draw a great picture, Tenno.\nThe name of the picture Is 'Home.'\"\nAnd as the face of the pictured woman\ngrew Into being it was very like that\nof the girl. A transformed Philip Dun\ncombe sharpened his crayons In fresh\nenthusiasm, and then with cruel sud\ndenness his dream was shattered.\n\u201cThe husband of the Indy who owns\nthe black cat.\u201d Tenno informed him.\n\u201chas also purchased a dog.\u201d\nPhilip stared dumbly. \u201cThe hus\nband. you say, of the lady?\" he re\npeated dazedly. Tenno nodded in con\nfirmation.\n\u201cShe passed me In the hall, and\nwhen I asked of the janitor-who she\nwas he replied:\n\u201cShe is a little married woman liv\ning in suit f>2, and that is her husband\nwith her.\u201d\nWith fingers that trembled Philip\nreplaced his pencils. \u201cAll right,\u201d he\nsnld brusquely. \u201cNow run along.\"\nAnd when the Japanese had gone\nPhilip took his finished sketch and\ntossed it in the fire. And the little\nblack cat was refused further admit\ntance.\n\u201cMr. nuneombc\u2019s sketch is finished,\u201d\nTenno told her surprised mistress.\nAfter a night and a day of unbearable\nlength Philip decided to end at any\ncost the role of patient invalid.\n\u201cYes, I will be at the club dinner,' I\nhe phoned in answer to Brown\u2019s\nurgent invitation. \u201cBut I\u2019ll cut out\nthe theater party afterward.\u201d\n\u201cRemember, sir. the physician\u2019s or\nders,\u201d Tenno cautioned.\n\u201cYou exaggerate the importance oi\nnfy state of health,\" Philip snid. Ha\nsvereaUmated his strength, however,\nand was obliged to call a taxi by tho\nway. \u201cStop for me again at 8 sharp.\u201d\nhe told the driver as he left the ear at\nbis club. . And he was glad that be\nhad untile this concession to weak\nness when he came out aguiu into the\nnight. The tnxi waited obediently.\n\"Forty-four?\u201d questioned the tnun.\nand. nodding absently. Philip' stepped\ninside. His head swam in an annoy\ning manner us they howled along, and\nhis hands were strangely cold. Then\npresently he became aware of a warm,\ncomforting, presence. Vaguely his\nhand reached out toward that familiar\nrhythmic sound:\n\u201cJack Johnson,\u201d Philip murmured in\nweary perplexity. He still cradled the\ninvincible cat against the lapel of his\ndress suit as he waited to pay the\ndriver.\n\"Found her, did you?\u201d the man ask\ned. \"The lady's cat followed her into\nthe car. you see, and she didn\u2019t discover\nher till we had reached the club. Then\nshe told me to keep the doors shut and\nshe would send the gentleman out to\ntake the cat home after dinner, so I\nbrought you here without further or\nders.\u201d\nHe sought the elevator, smiling grim\nly. So he had happened upon the same\ntaxi which had lately borne the girl.\nr \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 ~ \u2014\u2022 .. \u2014 \u00bb \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\u00bb.\n\u201cYOU HAVE BETRAYED MANY SECRETS,\u201d\nSHE CONFIDED.\nThis was the explanation. When Phil\nip reached the upper floor he released\nthe purring animat.\n\"You will have to find your own wny\nhome, Lady Lillie,\u201d he said. Then it\noccurred to him that he had dismissed\nTenuo for the night and that he was\nquite too ill to be alone. He recollect\ned also that Jim Brothers lived arouud\nsomewhere upon an upper floor nnd he\nhad better hunt him up. Jim Brothers\nfound his fellow club member standing\ngaunt and white in the doorway.\n\u201cI believe I\u2019m sick, Jim,\u201d Philip ex\nplained faintly. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m sure\u201d\u2014\nThen Philip Buncombe knew no more.\nWhen, after an endless season of con\nfusing dreums, he ngain opened ration\nal seeing eyes Philip realized that he\nwas resting comfortably in Jim Broth\ners\u2019 cozy den, with something soft and\nfamiliar lying very near his shoulder.\n\u201cJack Johnson,\u201d he whispered de\nlightedly.\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t leave you,\u201d spoke a\nvoice of sad and joyous memory. \u201cShe\nseemed to know that you were ill.\u201d\nPhilip rubbed his unbelieving eyes.\nStill the vision remained. \u201cWhat are\nyou doing here?\u201d he asked curtly.\n\u201cI live here,\u201d the girl replied. \u201cYou\nsee, I am Jim Brothers\u2019 sister.\u201d\n\"Sister?\u201d echoed Philip, trying to\ngrasp this stupendous fact.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAnd\nold Jim makes his home with you and\nyour\u2014husband.\u201d The girl shook her\nhead.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t acquired one,\u201d she an\nswered.\n\"But the janitor told Tenno\u201d\u2014 Philip\nbegnn excitedly.\n\u201cThe janitor jumps at conclusions,\u201d\nthe girl interrupted.\nPhilip sat up rashly. \u201cAnd you are\nnot\u2014married?\u201d he persisted. Jim\u2019s sis\nter laughed.\n\u201cNot in the least,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou\nare to lie down, if you please, Mr. Dun\ncombe, nnd keep quiet while I am re\nlieving your nurse. You have betrayed\nmany secrets.\u201d she confided, \u201cand have\ntalked more or less wildly. There was\nsomething about a missing face and a\npicture and much concerning a little\nmarried woman upstairs.\u201d\nPhilip\u2019s eyes met her s eloquently. 1\nthought that was you,\u201d he confessed.\nThe girl blushed rosily. \u201cOh!\" she\nmurmured as one vastly relieved. Sud\ndenly Philip leaned over the placed his\nhand upon hers.\n\u201cI want to tell you,\u201d he entreated\u2014\"I\nmust tell you now of the picture called\n\u2018Home.\u2019 \u201d But it was not alone of the\npicture he spoke. His tender, trem\nbling voice told the story of n hungry\nheart. \u201cIt is yjjr face I would have\nlooking into mine, dear,\u201d he said, \u201cin\nihe light of our own hearth fire.\u201d\nGathering the little black cat in her\narms, the girl laughed shakily. \u201cWe\ncan't refuse him Lady Lillie.\u201d she said,\n\u201cor his temperature might go racing,\nand we could not accept him nt once:\nthat would seem so disgracefully ea\nger.\u201d\nPhilip held out pleading arms, \u201cif\nyou can give me a crumb of hope.\" In\nbegged, \u201cI will be the happiest mou\nths luckiest \"man in the world.\"\n\u201cWhen you are quite well.\" the gir\nanswered, \u201cI will come to see you\"\nshe flashed at him a smile of radian*\npromise\u2014\u201cand\u2014black cats bring luel:!'\nshe said.\nJoin Our Christmas Club\nSTARTS WEEK OF DECEMBER 29th\nIn class 2, pay 2c the first week, 4c the second week,\n6c the third week,'and so on for 50 weeks and we\nwill mail you a check two weeks before Christmas\nfor $25.50.\nOr in class five, pay 5c the first week, 10c the second\nweek, 15c the third week, and so on, and we will\nmail you a check two weeks before Christmas for $63.75\n\\'ou may reverse the order of payment if you wish to\ndo so.

As to\nproduction of all sorts of lumber,\nthe south has advanced from 88.7\nper cent of the total in 1900 to\n61.5 per cent las year.

In nearly every southern\nstate the cut was largely increas\ned during the year named, while\nthe states of the northwest, with\nthe exception of Washington, al\nmost all show a decrease in the\namount taken from the forests.\nThe cursory reader is apt to\nfeel a glow of pride over these\nfigures as showing how the south\nern states are advancing, but\nhow long will our woodlands be\nable to stand this enormous\ndrain? Four billion feet taken\nrom them in a single year, and\nno concerted move made toward\nreforestation certainly spells an\nexhaustion of the supply.
