    "The Farm.\nSecond Crop In Peas.\nAfter the hogs and stock have\nhad the run of the field as long as\npossible, the land should be sowed\nin some variety of the late matur\ning cow pea, such as the Unknown.\nThis pea sowed as late as the 10th\nof July will harvest a magnificent\ncrop by the middle of October.\nThe value of the second crop,\nplanted in peas and without ferti\nlizers, will fall but little short of\nthe value of the wheat crop. In\ndependent of the high value of\nthe pea as a food for all kinds of\nstock, we must not forget their\nmanurial value to the land, in\ndrawing and depositing in the soil\na large supply of free nitrogen\nfrom the air. The stubble and\nroots will supply humus to the soil\nalso, and build up the physical\ncondition of the land. If the wheat\nfield is laid off into rows three\nfeet apart and the peas drilled and\ncultivated a heavier crop of peas\nmay be harvested, but it is cheap\ner to broadcast, plow in and har\nrow, cutting the vines when the\npods are ripening, than otherwise.\nAs many acres as possible may be\ncu\u2019tivated in peas for gathering\nand threshing out for seed to be\nused next year for sale, but this\ncan be done better by dropping\nand cultivating peas on the corn\nrows. In the corn field, and fol\nlowing wheat and oats, the cow\npea should be allowed all the space\nthat can possibly be devoted to its\ngrowth. Cow peas should be a\nsystem of rotation, be grown on\nevery acre-of land a farmer has,\nonce in every two or three years,\nand annually if possible. Wherev\ner it is grown there you have in\nfull operation a guano factory of\nyour own, actively engaged in\nmanufacturing and depositing in\nthe soil the highest priced plant\nfood, nitrogen, known to the chem\nist or to the farmer who has his\nfertilizers to buy.\nTwo city farmers had their crops\nof peas destroyed by the drought.\nOne came to condole with the oth\ner: \u201cAh,\u201d he said, \u201chow unfor\ntunate we have been. I have done\nnothing ever since but fret. But,\nbless me, you seem to have a fine,\nhealthy crop coming up just now.\nWhat are these?\u201d\n\u201cThese? Why, these are what\nI sowed immediately after our\nloss.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, coming up already?\u201d\n\u201cYes; while you were fretting I\nwas working.\u201d\nWhat, and don\u2019t you fret when\nyou have a loss?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I always put it off\nuntil I have repaired the mis\nchief.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, then, you\u2019ve no need to\nfret at all.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, and that is the very rea\nson. In truth, it is very pleasant\nto have no longer reason to think\nof misfortunes, and it is astonish\ning how many might be repaired\nby a little alacrity and energy,\nsince,\n\u201c \u2018For every evil \u2019neath the sun\nThere is a remedy or none.\nIf there be one, at once go find it;\nIf there be none, then never mind\nit.\u2019 \u201d__\nThere is no better killing agent\nfor the insects of the poultry house\nand cabbage field than the foliage\nof the tobacco plant, and there is\nnot a farm or garden from the\nNew York State line south, but on\nwhich enough could be grown for\nthe purpose, and not miss the\nground occupied. The leaves hung\nin closets or packed with clothing\nwill prevent loss from insects, and\nit is said roaches and other bugs\nof the house will not stay where\nthe leaves are stored. It was an\nold Roman maxim that the good\nfarmer never purchases that which\nhe can grow upon his land.\nMr. Youman, a farmer from\nSouth Carolina, testified before the\nIndustrial Commission in Wash\nington, that he had no fault to\nfind with colored labor, and that\nhe preferred it infinitely to im\nported labor. \u201cI employ 800 or\n400 negroes,\u201d he said, \u2018\u2018and I find\nthem docile and willing to work.\nI go away and leave my family\namong them, feeling confident of\ntheir safety and protection.\u201d\nThe Threshing Machine.\u2014\nWhen the t h r e s h i n g machine\nmakes its appearance always have\nplenty of help, so that the machine\ncan be every moment to feed its\nfmll capacity. The enormous rev\n, olution of the drum with its hea\nvy iron spikes must be Jfully fed\nwith straw to prevent the break\ning and cracking of the grain. The\nmachine must have its rate of\nspeed carefully regulated to do\ngood work, and if there is not suf\nficent help to feed it as fast as is\nrequired, the owner of the grain\nis sure to suff r, and will blame\nthe machine, when it is not re\nsponsible. If these conditions are\ncomplied with and good work is\nnot done, you have a right to com\nplain and should not hesitate to\ndo so. Watch the chaff box and\nthe travelling straw conductor,\nexamine the straw heads and see\nI if all the grains are being proper\nI ly knocked out. An old, worn\nout, rickety threshing machine\nwill sometimes waste enough grain\nin threshing a crop to pay the toll\nusually charged.\nJ. A.

Hut if it be not\nsuch an offence, as ought to draw down\nupon it the severity of penal inhibition,\nthen to vest in any individual such a pow\ner, 's 10 arm him with little les3 than\ntie potic authority. The period which\nwas supposed to justily this cruel mea\nsure has long since passed, and the be\nnignant spirit of an enlightened age, re\ngards with equal abhorrence, the injus\nlic; of the mandate that now strips the\ndebtor of his liberty, and that which se\nvered his body, and gave to each creditor\nhis proportioned share.\u2014The State is in\njured, for it loses the efforts of a useful\ncitizen. The creditor is not benefited ;\nfor the imprisonment of his debtor will\nnot satisfy his claim. The debtor is the\ndouble victim of bis misfortune and re\nvenge. If fraud is committed punish it\nby severe enactment: if concealment be\nperpetrated, expose the perpetrators to\ninfamous privations. But humanity and\njustice, the tears of infancy and inno\ncence, alike invoke prohibition of the\ndangerous power now ceded to the cre\nditor.\" \u2014\u2014\nTHE TWO FARMERS.\nTwo farmers, who were neighbors,\nhad their crops of early peas killed by the\nfrost.

The excess of the products\nof the sod beyond the consumption ol th<\n,-gncultuiaJ interest, must either find ^\n^ale in the home and the foreign markets\nor be lost to the proprietors. To reh\non foreign markets is to expose ourselvc\nto the caprice of foreign policy, and to\ncommit primary interests to the guardian- j\nship of rival nations.\u2014We must therefor i\nconsult the substantial and perm.n n '\nprosperity of agriculture, by providing\nfor the domestic consumption oi its pro\nductions ; and .this can only be accom\nphshed by the dense population of manu\nfacturing towns and commercial cities.\u2014\nAnd it is indeed highly satisfactory to\nwitness the growing prosperity of thr\nmanufacturing imeiest, after the blow\nwhich it received on the termination oi\nthe late war. Iu its fabrics, its consump\nlions and all its operations, it stimulates\nagricultural industry, by purchasing its\npioductions and administering to it3 ac\nccmmodatious. And as the superabun\ndance of the products of agriculture and\nmanufactures must create the materials\nfor foreign commerce, it is obvious that\nall these great departments of human in\ndustrv are dependent on each other, and\nare closely connected in promoting the g \u25a0\nnera\u2019 prosperity. A oairoa purely agricui\n' tuiad, winch derives the fabrics of art front\nforeign supplies, will almodt always be\npo r. Commerce, in older to be btnefi\ncia\u2019, ought to export more than it imports\nAnd the general .state of our country\nemphatically inculcates the necessity ol\nentrenching ourselves in our own recour\n; ces, ol cultiva ing the creative powers of\ni domestic industry, and of banishing those\nexcesses of luxury and exiravaganct\nwhich are the bane cf individual happi\nness and republican virtue. In the excess\nof our imports above our exports, the pro\ndigal consumption of foreign comroodi\nties, the unfavorable rate cf cxcl a ge.\nand the exhausting exportation of metal\nlie money, we perceive the sources and the\nsigns of individual distress and national\ndebility: aud the course cf this com\nmt-rce, which is recommended not bv the\nwealth it produces for the people, but bv\nthe revenue it creates for the govern\nment, must eventually be arrested by t\u2018n\npoverty and misery which it wT gent\nrate. There is no tiuth n ore evident th *.\nthat our importations must be finally go>\nerned by our exportations\u2014for, if we con\nsume more than we create, if we buy\nmore than we sell, we must sooner or la\nter encounter a crisis, when our credo\nand all our resources will be exhausted.\u201d\nVACCINATION.\nThe following letter from the Vaccine Agent at\nBaltimore, was laid before the House of Represen\ntaives on the 7th February.\nBaltimore, 4lh February, 1822.\nTo the Hon.

I ann fully persuaded I have dis\ncovered the true cause of the deplorable\nevents which have happened there ; and !\nI am now satisfied that they hate origin\nated from accident, such as never occur\nred before, and there is no danger that\nthe like will ever occur 3gain*\nI had a paper which contained some\nsmall-pox scabs taken by myself from a\nperson named Whitfield, about the 4:h\n1 October, 1821 ; and on this paper I h id\nwritten carefully to avoid accidents, that\nit contained variolous or small-pox mat\nter. But this paper was afterwerds mis\nlaid ; and \u00bbfter searching for it in vain,\nI had concluded it W3s lost, and supposed\nh might have been swept out of my office\nwith other waste papers.\nFrom the information, however, which\nI have received from Dr. Hunter, quot\ning the worth I had written on it, I have\nno doubt, hut that the same identical pi -\nper, containing the small pox scabs, and\nmarked as such, was put up in Dr. Witd\u2019s\n\u2018etter, by some mistake, or inadvertency,\ninstead of the glaises of vaccine matter\nwhich 1 intended to send him,,and which\nfrom his letter to me.

    "wsaEEsnsum\nTUESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1825.\nLite of Paul Jones.\u2014lt is incumbent on us to\n. notice, and we do it with great pleasure, the pub\nlication of a volume elucidating the Life and\n' Character of the celebrated John Paul Jones, by\ni-a citizen of this place, although the work was\n\u25a0 printed and published in New York. The great\n: mass of documents brought together for this pur\npose, were partly discovered by accident, not\nlong since, and partly furnished to the Editor\nfrom the offices of the General Government, and\nby distinguished individuals. I hey consist of\nletters, resolutions of Congress, correspondence\nwith many most eminent actors in the affairs of\nour Revolutionary war, and of reports of J. P.\nJones himself, concerning the more interesting\nscenes in which he was engaged. These are\nconnected with occasional narration to give them\nintel legibility and consistency. The external\n-appearance of the work is not entirely worthy of\nthe interesting matter it contains. As it is,\nhew ever, it is a highly valuable addition to the\npub lie light which half a century has thrown\nu^c n the actions and character of that inter\nest in\" generation which has just retired from\n\u2022 stage, and can only live hereafter in the page\nhistory. For although a few stragglers, of the\nJendid galaxy that conducted our country to\n.^dependence and laid the foundation of its pre\n> sent enviable condition, still survive ; it is not to\nshare the labors, but to receive, as companions\nand representatives of the mighty dead, the ho\nmage of the existing generation.\nIt was a singular happiness and honor for North\nAmerica, when the interests of the then British\ncolonies required a separation from the mother\ncountry, that the unbending love of liberty was\nassociated with the love of order ; that the contest\nwas viewed by enlightened and liberal men eve\nry where, as a matter of much higher concern\nment than the mere local happiness of the inhabi\ntants of these States. They considered it as a\nstruggle for the rights of man\u2014as an experiment\nthat would try the problem whether absolute pow\ner might not be put down, and good government\nproduced by agreement, by voluntary compact of\nrhe People, the only rightful source of Power.\nHence eminent men of various nations, even some\nclaimed as native subjects of the very power we\nhad to contend with, volunteered as defenders of\nAmerican Liberty. Lafayette, Steuben, De\nkalb, Pulaski, and Paul Jones, and many\nothers, may be mentioned among these, who had\nmore respect to principle, than national feeling ;\nand who emphatically fought fur Liberty.\nThe event justified their enthusiasm, and, in\nits consequences has shown, and will further\nshow, that the Battle of the World was fought in\nthe United States. It is the country of freemen\n\u2014the barrier between them and despotism ; to\nthis, as,his last earthly asylum, the patriot from\nevery part of the world turns his eyes.\nIt is good, therefore, to be brought more close\nly acquainted with those dauntless spirits that as\nsisted in the great achievement for mankind. We\nhave hitherto known some of them only by a few\npublic actions. Of the celebrated subject of this\nvolume, the brilliant actions he performed have\nbeen scarcely sufficient to redeem his character\nfrom the obloquy and misapprehension with which\ncalumnious tradition loaded it. The present work\nexposes the injustice, and furnishesus with a clear\ninsight into the very heart and feelings of Paul\nJones; and we hope it will be extensively diffus\ned and read.\nThe last received Georgia papers contain se\nveral columns of additional correspondence be\ntween the Executive of that State and General\nGaines, and between the former and the Govern\nment oi the United States ; which appears to\nembrace all the documents produced by that fruit\nful source, and which we shall endeavor to find\nroom for in a few days.\nWe are authorized to declare, that the state\nment recently made by us upon the authority of\na Boston paper, that Judge Story had agreed to\nbecome a contributor to the newspaper, called the\nBoston Journal, about to be established in Bos\nton, is unfounded in fact. Judge S. has entered\ninto no such arrangement, nor has he ever been\nconsulted on the subject. Since he has taken his\nseat on the Bench, he has abstained from writing\nin the newspapers.\nGeneral Scout of the army, was solicited late\nly to accept of a Public Dinner, at Lexington,\nKentucky, by some of the most respectable citi\nzens ot the State. General Scott declined the\nproffered compliment, in terms and for reasons\nthat do much credit to his good sense and discretion.\nThe projected Miami Canal, in Ohio, was\ncommenced on the 21st ultimo, bv breaking\nground, near Middletown. A great concourse cl\npeople attended on the occasion, and the event\nwas celebrated by parades, a public dinner, &c.\nGovernor Clinton and his suite were present,\nhaving been escorted thither from Cincinnati, by\nthe Cincinnati hussars and guards. Governor\nMorrow and other officers of Ohio were also pre\nsent. After an address, prayer, &c. were finish\ned, the two Governors, were conducted by the\nCanal Commissioners to the spot selected for the\npurpose, \u201c where (says the account,) each taking\na spade, commenced simultaneously this great\nwork of improvement.\u201d On the next morning,\nfive teams and a large number of hands were ac\ntively employed in carrying on the work.\nARRIVAL OF THE HORNET.\nNorfolk, Aug. 5.\nThe United States\u2019 sloop of war Hornet, E, P.\nKennedy, Esq. Commander, anchored at Old\nPoint Comfort last evening at 6 o\u2019clock, in nine\ndays from Havana, having left that port on the\n26th ult. To Captain Kennedy and Lieutenant\nCunningham, who came up from the ship last\nnight, we are indebted for the following intel\nligence :\nThe Hornet met going into Havana a French\nfleet of IS men of war, 12 of them ships, four of\nwhich of the line.\nWe regret to have to add to the list of valua\nble officers who have fallen victims to the inhos\npitable climate of the West Indies, Lieutenant\nWilliam Lawton, first of the Constellation, who\ndied on the 22d of July of the yellow fever. He\nwas a highly meritorious officer, and a gentleman\nof great private worth. Lieutenants Henley and\nLawton were the only cases of fever that had oc\ncurred on board the Constellation, and both are\nbelieved to have originated at Key West.\nThe t onstellation and John Adams were off\nHavana, giving convoy. The Spark was cruiz\ning on the south side of Cuba. The Grampus,\nFox, and Terrier, were at Matanzas. We are\nhappy to learn, that the crews of all these vessels\nboth officers and men, were in excellent health,\nnot a case of fever (except the two above named)\nhaving occurred on board of one of them.\nThe Hornet has been absent 13 months, and the\naverage number of sick daily reported for the\nyear ending the 30th July, have been about four\nteen, making a total of 5110 patients attended\nduring the year ; of this number there h v \u25a0 been\nbut four deaths, one of bilious remittent fever, one\nof paralytic, one of disease produced by intoxica\ntion, and the last (Doctor lan Brunt, the Sur\ngeon\u2019s Mate,) of a lingering disease of the liver,\nwhich had been brought on by a cruise in the\nWest Indies last year.\nThe greatest numberof sick reported at one time\nwas 64, all of which were cases of an epidemic\nfever, that made its appe.arancs on board a few\ndays after the ship left St. Thomas, but by the\ntimely application of proper remedies, it disap\npeared, without the loss of a single man. The\ncrew of the Hornet are now in a perfect state of\nhealth, the sick report amounting only to four,\nand these chronic case.s of debility only.\nLIEUTENANT HENLEY.\nAn obituary notice of this lamented officer,\npublished in the Norfolk Beacon, contains the\nfollowing sketch of his professional career :\n\u201c Mr. IE was a native of James City, Va. and received\nhis appointment as a Midshipman, in January 1809. hav\ning previously served.as a volunteer in the gun-boats\nstationed at this place. In June following, he sailed for\nHolland in the U. S. schooner Enterprize, commanded\nby the gallant Trippc ; he was subsequently with that\nofficer in the U. S. brig Vixen, a ben she was fired at\nby H. B. M. brig Moselle, off the Double Headed Shot\nKeys, and for which an apology was made by her com\nmander to Capt. Trippe.\nLieut. H. served on the New Orleans station for many\nmonths, in the gun-boats and on board the brig Syren,\nin which vessel he arrived at Boston in the summer of\n1813.. After a short visit to his friends, he received or\nders to repair to New York, to join the ship Peacock,\nCaptain'Aarrington, then fitting out at that port. In\nher he sailed oil a cruise as 2d Lieut, and assisted in the\ncapture of the Epervier. Honorable mention was made\nof his good conduct in that action : he was in the same\nvessel and with the same commander, when she captur\ned, in the Straits of Sunda, the East India Company\u2019s\nbrig Nautilus, just at the conclusion of the war. The\n!\u2019eacock returned to the U. S. in Nov. 1815.\nMr. H. was subsequently with Capt. Warrington, as\nhis first Lieutenant, in the Macedonian and Guerriere\nfrigates, and in fact has since invariably been selected\nby that discerning and distinguished commander, as his\nfirst officer, when afloat. In January, 1823, Lt. Henley\nwas appointed to the command of the U. S. sch\u2019r Ferret,\none of Commodore Porter\u2019s anti-piratical squadron,\nwhich sailed from this port in February following ; and,\nhaving served in that arduous expedition for several\nmonths, he returned to the U. S. in bad health, t'n his\nappointment to the command of the West India squad\nron, Commodore Warrington immediately selected Lt\nHenley to as Captain of the fleet, in the exercise of the\nduties of which station he died.\u201d\nVVe learn, says the Michigan Herald, that Go\nvernor Cass and his party were to leave Green\nBay, for the Prairie, ou the morning of the 14th\ninstant.\nWe are sorry to learn, that Lieut. Lowe, of\nthe U. S. army, who was a passenger on board\nthe I\u2019iger, was knocked overboard by the main\nboom, soon after the schooner got under weigh,\nand was drowned.\nThe Great Ship.\u2014 The Canadian Courant states\nthat upwards of 300 men are now engaged in\nloading this enormous vessel, and ten horses are\nemployed in raising the logs with the assistance\nof pulley and tackle, from the ship\u2019s side. It is\nrather a novel spectacle to witness so many\nhorses at work on a ship\u2019s deck, the same as if\nthey were laboring in a field.\nLast Monday an election of Members of the\nLegislature, &c. was to take place in Ken\ntucky. The contest was between the Relief\nand Anti Relief Parties, the Judge-Breakers and\nand Anti-Judge-Breakeis; and each side ex\npressed a confidence of victory.\n3avingg.~-It appears by the semi-annual state\nment of the Boston Savings Bank, that its capital\namounts to 7u8,826 dollars, which is all invested,\nexcept about 3,000 dollars.\nThe extraordinary case which occurred in thv\nWestern Country, 1823, of the oozing of clots\nof blood (bones} from the face of a girl, has been\nconfirmed tua letter to Professor Chapman, from\na respectable gentleman who was an eye witness\nand a scientific observer of the phenomenon.\nI'he letter is published in the number that has\njust appeared of the Philadelphia Journal of the\nMedical and Physical Sciences,\nInternal Improvement.\u2014-The delegates elec\nted in the several counties in Pennsylvania, as\nsembled in the Hall of the House of Represen\ntatives at Harrisburg on Thursday last. Joseph\nLawrence, p V\u00bb ashingtou Conn y, was elected\nPresident, and NatFl.P. Hobart, of Berks coun\nty, and Francis P. Shurik, of Dauphin county,\nwere appointed Secretaries. The several certi\nficates of election were read and approved. Th\"\nmeeting being thus organized, John Sergeant, of\nPhiladelphia, addressed the meeting, at some\nlength on the advantages which must inevitably\nresult to the state from opening a facile means o'\nintercourse, between the Eastern and Western\nparts of the commonwealth. He declined touch\ning upon the question of what route would be\nbest, or what would be\u201cthe best means of fitting\nup whatever route might, upon examination ami\nconsideration, be thought most advisable. He\nremarked that within the last seventeen years,\nPennsylvania had expended eleven millions three\nhundred and forty nine thousand seven hundred\nand seventy-nine dollars on internal improve\nment, yet that no one had ever imputed any por\ntion of distress to that expenditure. He was\nvery clearly of opinion, that whatever may be the\nroute, or in whatever manner it is to be improv\ned, it should be done by the. State. He conclud\ned by moving the appointment of a committee,\nto prepare and report resolutions for the consid\neration of the convention. The following com\nmittee having been appointed, the meeting ad\njourned until four o\u2019clock P. M.\nJolin Sergeant, Henry King, Samuel D Ingham, Jacob\nHolgate, Joseph Patterson, Thomas H. Still, John H.\nForster, Thomas 11. Haird, P. S. Markley.\u2014Dem, Press.\nQuantity of Blood in Animals.\u2014Those who\nhave not considered the subject must be surpris\ned at the quantity of blood which passes through\nthe heart of any moderately sized animal in the\ncourse of twenty-four hours. In man, the quan\ntity of blood existing in the body at any given\nmoment, is probably from 30 to 40 pints. Of\n-these, an ounce and a half, or about three table\nspoonfuls, are sent out at every stroke ; which,\nmultiplied into 75, (the average rate of the pulse,)\ngive 1,125 ounces or seven pints in a minute,\ni. e. 420 pints, or 25 1-2 gallons, in an hour, and\n1,260 gallons, i. e. nearly 24 hogsheads, in a\nday. Now, if we recollect that the whale is said\nto send out from its heart at each stroke 15 gal\nlons, the imagination is overwhelmed with the\naggregate of the quantity that must pass through\nthe heart of that animal in 24 hours. It is a ge\nneral law that the pulse of the larger animals is\nslower than that of the smaller; but even if we\nput the pulse of the whale so low as 20 in tl)f\nminute, the quantity circulated through the heart,\ncalculated at 15 gallons for each pulsation, will\nbe 432,000 gallons, equal to 8,000 hogsheads m\n24 hours. The consideration of this amazing\nquantity is, however, a su.ijectofmere empty won\nder, if not accompanied with the reflection, that, in\norderto produce theaggregate amount,theheart is\nkept in constant motion; and that, in fact, it is\nincessantly beating, as it is termed, or throwing\nout the blood into the arteries, from the first pe\nriod of our existence to the moment of our death,\nwithout any sensation of fatigue, or even without\nconsciousness, excepting under occasional corpo\nreal or mental agitation.\n[Dr. Kidd.

It is one of the most excellent, as well\nas most interesting and amusing publications of\nthe day. We do not know who the editor is,\nbut it is evident fr un the paper that he is not on\nly a man of superi r talent and wit, but learned\nand -killed in bis profession ns a physician. The\npaper contains much original matter, c .uffiy on\ncommon and seasonable subjects, and is riclriyen\ntitled to an extensive patronage, which we htqie\nit receives. We have frequently enriched our\ncolumns with extracts from the Intelligencer.\nI\u2019he following is entitled to particular attention ;\nir Siatesman.\n\u201c Strong Beer. \u2014This is strictly an English\nman\u2019s drink, and by far the most wholesome of\nany fermented beverage which has ever been of\nfered for sale. It is now becoming an important\narticle in families, and if the brewers could be en\ncouraged by wholly interdicting the use of spirit\nu ns I qimrs, the moral condition of the whole\nnation wmll be meliorated. Never were the\nboring people, in any country, more completely\na community of drunkards, than in some sections\nof the United States. Wc have such an intoler\nable hatred to every thing approximating intem\nperance, that we almost hiSe our temper by sim\nply writing the word. There was a time in the\nreign of Queen Elizabeth, when rum and brandy\nwere sold bv the ounce, by apothecaries, as a me\ndicine, and a teaspoon full was considered a dose,\nby all the regular physicians. What would those\nsage and learned men, viri, graves et dacti, say,\nwere they to see a man and his wife, in tcese\ndays of dissipation, swallowing down two gills a\npiece, over a surloin of mutton, to facilitate di\ngestion I Let laborers have strong beer\u2014not too\nstrong neither, and those who do nothing, would\nbe, infinitely better oft' to use it too. Beer strength\nens the system ; gives activity to the chylopoetic\nviscera ; promotes the secretions, and ensures a\nclear mind. There is such a thing as abusing the\nuse of this valuable article, but it will require an\nimmensely longer period to produce manta a po\ntu, by malt beer, than by cogniac or any other\nkind of spirit. We can form a very correct opi\nnion of a man\u2019s importance in society by watch\ning his movements at a bar-room. A disefeet, so\nber, business mini, calls for a simple glass of beer;\nthe man who earns his daily bread by the sweat\nof his brow, pays fourpence for a glass of rum,\nwhi e his disconsolate wife is wearing herself in\nto the grave to save as much at home ; the cock\nney calls for a whole bottle of wine, and if he\nwishes to make an imposing appearance before\nhis inferiors, takes a second of champaigne\u2014the\nco mini u every day business man takes a dram at\nnine, eleven, and four, and the man of no business\nat aH, drinks the whole time. Encourage the\ngeneral use of Deer, and drunkards will diminish,\ntippling will go out of fashion, and health and\nfamily happiness will abound where wretchedness\nand misery have long been predominant.\u201d\nMortar of Potatoes\u2014by M. Cadet de VauXr-^-\n!n a court yard there was a wall, the part of\nwhich nearest the ground had been repaired ten\ntimes, so that the mason hesitated to repair it\nany more, when I proposed to bim to mix boiled\npotatoes with his plaster. Let me confss it;\nhe laughed in my face, and shrugged his shoul\nders. However, I went to the hog\u2019s trough,\ntook out some boiled potatoes, and put about\na pound into the mason\u2019s trough. The repair\nwas completed, and the wall has remained\nn good condition for several years, offering the\nfollowing phenomenon, viz.\u2014lt retains its solidi\nty, notwithstanding the efflorescence on the sur\nface of salt-petre, which is found cbrystalized.\nihe result naturally led me to mix b iled pota\ntoes in th\u00ae composition of the coat of plaster, and\nstill more of argillaceous earth ; which has per\nfectly succeeded on a shed in a garden, which is\nexposed to every wind, and the sides of which\nare composed only of hurdles, covered over with\na mixture of argillaceous earth and boiled po\ntatoes.\nIf these particulars could come to the know\nledge of the poor people in the country, their\nwretched hovels would become habitations dry\nwithinside, and consequently healthy.\n\u2019The Duke of York has been presented with a\nbill from his tailor to the modest amount of\n12,000 pounds sterling [jtbout 50,000 dollars.J\nIt has been the subject of debate in Parliament.\nSome of those interested in the discussion,\nthought that the tailor did not pinchhis Highness\nin the size of his bill.

By admitting the stranger\nIndisciiminately to the exercise of those high attributes\nwhich constitute the rights of the native born American\ncitizen, we weaken the attachment of the native, and\ngain naught but the sordid allegia ce of the foreigner.\nThe rights of the American, which he holds under the\nConstitution of the Revolution, and exercised by him\nas the glorious prerogative of his birth, are calculated to\nstimulate to action, condense to strength, a cement in\nsentiment and patriotic sympathy.\nBasing, then, the right and duty to confederate on these\nhigh truths, we profess no other object than the promotion\nof our native country in all the walks of private honor,\npublic credit, and national independence; and therefore\nwe maintain the right, in its most extended form, ot the\nnative born American, and he only, to exercise the vari\nous duties incident to the ramifications of the laws, exec\nutive, legislative, or ministerial, from the highest to the\nlowest post of the Government?and to obtain this great\nend, we shall advocate the entire repeal of the naturalisa\ntion laws by Congress. Aware that the Constitution for\nbids, and even if it did not, we have no wish to establish.\nexpost facto laws : the action we seek with regard to the\nlaws of naturalization, is intended to act in - prospective\ncharacter. U e shall advocate equal liberty to all who\nwere born equally free ; to be so born, constitutes, when\nconnected with moral qualities, in our minds, the aristoc\nracy of human nature. Acting under these generic prin\nciples, we further hold that, to be a permanent people\nwe must be a united one, bound together by sympathies,\nthe result of a common political organ; and to be national,\nwe must cherish the iVative American sentiment, to the\nentire and radical exclusion of foreign opinions and doc\ntrines introduced by foreign paupers and European poli\ntical adventurers. From Kings our gallant forefathers\nwon their liberties?the slaves of Kings shall not win\nthern back again.\nReligiously entertaining these sentiments, we as so\nlemnly believe that the day has arrived, when the Ameri\ncans should unite as brothers to sustain The strength and\npurity of their political institutions. We have reached\nthat critical period foreseen and prophesied by some of\nthe clear-si?hted apostles of freedom, when danger threat\nens from every ship that floats on the ocean to our shores\n?when every wind that blows walls the ragged paupers\nto our cities, bearing in their own persons and characters\nthe elements of degradation and disorder. To prevent\nth'-fe evils, we are now called upon to unite our energies.\nTo fight over this great moral revolution, the shallow of\nour first revolt of glory, will be the duty of the sons of\nthese wars, and we must go into the combat determined\nto abide by our country ; to preserve her honor free from\ncontagion; and her character as a separate people, high\nand above the engiaftment of monarchical despotisms.\nARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION.\nFirst. We bind ourselves to co-operate, by all lawful\nmeans, with our fellow native citizens in the United\nStates to procure a repeal of the naturalization laws.\nSecond. We will use all proper and reasonable exer\ntions to exclude foreigners from enjoying the emoluments\nor honors of office, whether under the General qr State\nGovernment7.\nThird. That we will not hold him guiltless of his coun\nry's wrong, who, having the power, shall place a foreign\ner in office while there is a competent native willing to\naccept.\nFourth. That we will not. in any form or manner, con\nnect ourselves with the general or local politics of the\ncountry, nor aid, nor be trie means of aiding, the cause\nof any politician or party whatsoever, but will exclusive\nly advocate, stand to, and be a sepaiate and independent\nparty of native Americans, lor the cause ot the country,\nand upon the principles as set loith in the above pream\nble and these articles.\nFifth. That we will not, in any manner whatever, con\nnect ourselves, or be connected, with any religious sect\nor denomination : leaving every creed to its own strength,\nand every ui.m untrammelled in his own faith ; adhe.ing,\nfor ourselves, to the sale cause of the natives, the es\ntablishment of a national character, and the peipetuity of\nour institutions, through the mean? of our own countrymen.\nSixth.

Ttit* most distressing and irrational ef\nfects on the powers of man, but more particul r\nly of woman, are sometimes produced by tear?\nit predisposes the body to contagious disorders,\ninduces cowardice where nothing should be\ndreaded, and under circumstances of great ex\ncitement closes up the understanding, leaving\nthe individual who becomes a prey to it an idiot\nfor the remainder of a miserable existence. It\nis no less extraordinary than true, that fear ari\nsing from evident danger is less subduing than\nwhen produced by the powers of imagination.\nThere are numerous occupations, surrounded b.\nterrors, which lose their effect upon the mind by\nthe frequency of recurrence. The pursuits of\nthe seaman, the miner and others, for instance,\nprove, that on hearts accustomed to look danger\nin the face, fear exercises no overwhelming pow\ners,- because the senses being first to discover th\ndanger, its elfect is proportionate to the experi\neuce or intimacy with the cause. Ignorance is\na cause of astonishment, and darkness heightens\nthe effect of fear, only because the senses can\nnot act in conjunc tion with the understanding.\nIf light be cast on the scene, the alarming ob\njects, if there beany, are seen, and resistance is\ncalculated accordingly. That there are gradua\ntions of personal couarge, is as true as that there\nare various degrees of strength in man?but tim\nid persons, however they may have become so,\nhave objects of terror ever ready to destroy thei r\npowers of discernment. If an individual be\nselected, possessed of health, moral courage and\nexperience, in all cases of alarm his physical\npowers assist his mental energies and he is not\neasily subdued : at least, there certainly will be\nno evident prostration of his understanding.\nThe cause of yielding to imaginary terrors, per\nhaps, may be traced through a morbid state of\nthe nervous system, and an igriorance of the law\nof nature, up to tales of supernatural appearan\nces recited in the nursery, the effect of which\nis a mental slavery, from which there is no re\nlief. but in the examination of cause and effect\nin nature.as leading to knowledge of nature'sGod,\nwhere there will be found so much to fill the\nmind with satisfaction and thankluluess, that there\nwill be no room for imaginary terrors, nothing to\ndread, save doing wrong.

That look which could\nhave awed a Roman Senate, in its Fabrician\ndav, was bent in filial tenderness upon the time\nworn features of this venerable matron.\nThe great man wept. A thousand recollec\ntions crowded upon his mind, as memory, retra\ncing scenes long past, carried him back to his\npaternal mansion, and the days of his youth ?\nand there the centre of attraction was his moth\ner, whose care, instruction, and discipline, had\nprepared him to reach the topmost height of\nlaudable ambition; yet how were his glories\nforgotten while he gazed upon her from whom,\nwasted by time and malady, he must soon part\n11 meet no more !\nThe matron's predictions were true.

I verily be\nlieve that such a man would think such\nmen but little short of fools. lean a\ngree with chewing, for it seems na\ntural; the mouth having been made to\nmasticate articles, of food; and those\nwho will chew what was not exactly\nmade for chewing, why let them \u2014\nthey have the worst of it.

Bernard, of this city.\nParity Bth Sept. 1830.\nMr Dear General:\nAbundance of news must have reached you\nthrough the periodic,il papers. Nevertheless,\nI think it will be, pleasing to you to receive\nsome written details. You will have receiv\ned some publications relating to our memora\n,ble week. You will also have, read an account\nof the Review by the King, in the Champ de\nMars, for the distribution of our tri-colored\nflags to the National Guard. The ceremony\nwas as splendid as that of the Federation of\nv 1790. We had five hundred thousand spec\ntators; and every one was struck with the ce\nlerity with which in less than three weeks we\n'have organized nearly fifty thousand men of\nNational Guards\u2014armed, equipped, and tiling\n-off like veteran troops. The King handed\nsuccessively to the General Commander-in-\nChics the forty-eight ti i-colored flags, each\nsurmounted with a cock in lieu of the old im\nperial eagle, and with this motto: \u201c Liberty-\nPublic Order\u2014Days of 27th, 28th, 29th July.\n1830.\u201d The Commander-in-Chief took him\nself the new oath, and had it administered to\nthe National Guard. The Colors were in\ntrusted to flag-bearers, selected from among\nthe mechanics who had distinguished them\nselves in fighting in the barricades. The\nNational Guards are organizing throughout\nFrance. We have already fourteen thousand\nanew for the two arrondissements only of St.\nDenis and Sceaux.\nI send to you the order of the day which I\naddressed to the National Guards of the king\ndom. Next week, a law will be proposed for\nthe final organization of the French National\nGuard. AH the citizens will compose the sta\ntionary Guard ; the young men the moveable\nNational Guard. From seven to eight hun\ndred thousand fighting men will thus form good\ncorps of reserve.\nYou know that some disturbances have ta\nken place in Belgium: they will end, I think,\nby the separation of that country from Hol\nland, under the same sovereign. We have\nnot interfered, except to signify that we shall\nnot suffer that any foreign army should exer\ncise any right of interference, leaving the na\ntions to manage their own affairs according to\ntheir will, but not willing that other govern\nments shall interfere to oppress our neighbors.\n1 send you the exact account of what has\ntaken place in the Chamber relative to South\nAmerica and Mexico.

But in consideration of the\nimportance and multiplicity of his duties;- the General\nCommander in Chief must necessarily rely (of which he\nihas indeed the happy certainty) on the patriotism, upon\n\u00abthe zeal, and he may be permitted to\u2019 add, tiie personal\naffection of his Brothers in arms throughout the vast ex-\nSent of our brave and free country of France.-\nAfter forty years of memorable vicissitudes; the old\ntri-colored flag of \u2019B9, the flag of the national sovereign\n-iy, of liberty and of public order, has just beenglbrious-\nJy, generously and forever re-established\u2014around this\nstandard has rallied with a spontaneous movement,' and'\nwill soon be legally organized, all France in armss\nThe French people, profiting by the lessons of ex\nperience, by the progress of light, and civic intelligence,\nand appreciating the glory and benefits of our political\nstorms; casting off all that deprived their first impulse of\ntheir purity, feels much more the necessity for general1\nand personal security, now that the happy division of\nproperty and the advancement of industry, render it\nmore and more necessary.

Their contents arc highly im\nportant. A revolution has taken place against\nthe government\u2014a battle has been fought be\ntween its partisans and its opposers\u2014the latter\nhave been victorious and entered the capital.\nThe first document which presents itself to\nour notice, is a \u201c Declaration of the Garrison\nof the Capital of Magdalena,\u201d pronounced in\nCarthagcna on the 2d of August. It begins\nthus :\n\u201cThe Commandant General of the Departrn'ent (Ma\nriano Montilla) having' received inforrnation of the De\nclaration of the Province of Socorro in favor cf the na\ntion's remaining entire, and of the constitution recently\nadopted, and declaring his Excellency the Liberator,\nGeneralissimo of the army; also, taking into considera\ntion the critical circumstances of the capital (Bogota) in\nconsequence of the resolution taken by the Callao bat\ntalion and the neighboring population ; and considering\nthe imperious necessity which devolves upon this garri\nson, of devising means without delay, for preserving the\nintegrity of (he Republic, and savingour population from\nthe horrors of anarchy; proceeds to convoke a Junta of\nWar, composed of all the officers in the place, in order to\nhear their opinions, apd decide on the course of conduct\nto be pursued in this important crisis.n\nA meeting was accordingly held in the eve\ning of the same (lily, at which ail the officers\nwere present except , two, who were detained\nby sickness, and one who was absent at his\ncountry seat. Among those who attended\nwere Generals Carreiio, Uc'rds, O\u2018Leary,\nLuque, and Blanco\u2014seven Colonels, two Cap\ntains of the Navy, ten First Commandants,\nand various other .subordinate officers. The\nfollowing considerations were adopted by the\nJunta :\n1. That the communication with the capital is inter\nrupted by besieging troops, and that the present condi\ntion of the government is unknown.\n, 2. That while the situation of the government is inti\nmated by creditable letters from Honda, news has been\nreceived from Venezuela, which in connexion with that\nfrom Socorro, given us to understand distinctly the spirit\nwhich prevals in the great body of the Republic.\n3. That it is very probable the Declaration of Socorro\nwill be seconded by the other Provinces of the Depart\nment of Boyaca, and that the other Departments will\nsoon follow ; since it is well known by the public prints,\nletters, &c., that a desire prevails for maintaining the in\ntegrity of the Republic, and that His Excellency, the Li\nberator, should take command of the army.\n4. That as the army is the protector of the public li\nbefties, it seems to be in accordance with the will of the\npeople to declare for the same sentiments and support\nthtem by their arms.\n5. That the claims supported by the Callao battalion,\nare not only theirs, but afeb the claims of the people in\nthe vicinity of the capital; and the individuals of mbst\nrespectability, honor and patriotism, within its precincts ;\nand that these demands are justified by the conduct of\nfife present Ministry.\n6J. That this Ministry, at the head of a faction of de\nmagogues, and uncontrolled by reasons, has openly com\nmitted a multitude of outrages upon the Constitution,\nsome of which have been stated in the public prints',\n7. That the government being surrounded by this fac\ntion; cannot possibly act: With freedom, or promote the\ncommon felicity ; and that therefore it would be danger\nous,if not wfohg, to execute the orders which may ema\nnate from the Ministry.\n8. And lastly\u2014That this Ministry ha# rendered itself\nodious to the army by its unconstitutional acts, and be\ncause most of its members\u2019 receive the public execration\non account of their conduct, their connexion with the\nconspiracy of 25th September, 1828, and\u2019the protection\nthey have afforded and are still affording to the actors in\nthat scene, and the assassins of thb Grand Marshal of\nAyacucho [Gen. Sucre.}\nI\u2019he Junta then decided, almost triianimbus\nly, that under existing circumstances the\nCommandant General ought not to' obey the\norders which he might receive from the Go\nvernment at Bogota, and furthermore, that it\nwas his duty to render assistance, as far as\nhe was able without endangering the internal\nsecurity of the Department, to those Depart\nments which had declared, or might declare,\nin favor of a change of Ministry, the Consti\ntution, and the integrity of the Republic.\nThey also agreed to invite the Liberator to\nplace himself at the head of the army\u2014al\nthough the Commandant General suggested\nthat such an invitation might give opportuni\nty to his enemies to accuse him of more ma\nchinations, and to load him with new insults.\nGen. Briceno declared that he would obey no\nother orders but those which emanated from\nthe Liberator, or from a Chief appointed\u2019 by\nthe Liberator. A deputation was then chosen\nto wait upon- his Excellency, ami inform him\nof the wishes of the Junta. The Declaration\nis signed by the Commandant General, and\nby all the other officer^ present.\nOn the following day? Sept. 3, a similar\nDeclaration-was made by the civil officers and\nprincipal citizens of Carthagcna. in the Sa\nloon of the Palace, and is entitled the Pro\nnunciamento of the capital of Magdalena.\u201d\nIt is signed by the Prefect of the Department,\nand numerous other citizens.\nREVOLUTION IN BOGATA.\nA Carthagena date of September Bth, com\nmunicates some very interesting details under\nthe head of \u201c Pacification of the Capital and\nchastisement of the Demagogues.\u201d We make\nthe following translations :\nThe Bogota mail of August 28th, has just\narrived, and brings confirmation of the news\nwhich we have already presented to the pub\nlic.

The Commander-in Chief, Col, Flo\nrencio Imenes, directed the second company of Callao to\ndefend a small entrenchment, which covered our princi\npal left and commanded a large extent of the Bridge.\nThey resolved upon a decisive attack, in order to three\nus from the situation which we occupied, marching their\nwhole force in a long and dense column through the pass\nof the Bridge, with two pieces of cannon. Our advanced\nline fired upoh the enemy at pistol shot distance, and from\nthat moment the battle was warmly contested on their\npart; the guerillas of our left, and the forces of the en\ntrenchment answered their discharges by a deadly fire;\nbut as they still persisted in the attempt to drive us from\nour position, the Commander-in-Chief ordered the troops\nof-the centre to charge witlv the bayonet, which was\n| >iandsnnlply received anil, returned by flicm. Nothing\nI aaUMted, our-commander directed a second charge,which\nresulted4lO<better than the'first. Irritated by the little\n| success produced by both attacks, he then united the\nI forces of the centre, and those of the entrenchment,\nwhich, supported by the squadrons Guias and Flanquea\ndores, charged a third time,' and threw them into disor\nder. At the same time , the first and second squadrons\nwere directcd to charge the right flank of the enemy,\nand from that moment their cofumns were routed.\nThe victory was complete and absolute, there remain\ning in our power 3 Colonels, 37 Chiefs and Officers, and\n532 rank and file, besides 1 Col., 7 Chiefs, J J Officers,\n<ind 218 rank and file killed or wounded on the field of\nbattle.

The very fine ap\npearance of the orchards on his farm,\nand the unusual size of the fruit, led to\nthe inquiry of the means by which this\nwas effected. Mr. Perley attributes it\nprincipally to his mode of pfuning the\ntrees. Phis he does every year; and\ntakes off a much larger proportion of\nthe branches than is usually done. By\npermitting the sun and air to have free\naccess to every branch of the tree, the\nfruit will be richer, larger, fairer, and\nmore abundant This theory derives\nsupport from the fact, that the fruit on\nthe southern side of a free is generally\nmuch superior to that on the northern.\nAnother effect of annual pruning is to\nproduce annual bearing \u2022 and this Mr.\n1 erley states to have been the case with\nhis trees, and those in the vicinity that\nhave been treated in a similar manner.\nSeveral acres of cold, wet meadow\nland on this farm have been reclaimed,\nand rendered productive of the best up\nland hay, by ditching and turning the\nwater from it, and then using the plough\nand harrow, without any manure what\never.\nMr. Perley has made some interest\ni. g experiments upon manure; and stales\nthat he finds much advantage in convey\ning the wine of his cattle upon compost\nheaps of earth and marsh mud. This is\na practice generally neglected by our\nfarmers. It is believed that, by proper\nattention, nearly as much valuable ma\nnuie can be made from the urine as\nfrom the dung of the cattle.\nThe firm of Capt. Paul Kent, situate\non Kent\u2019s Island, (so called) in Newbu\nry, contains about 250 acres. Capt.\nKent lias paid considerable attention to\nthe cultivation of root crops, and is mak\ning some interesting experiments to as\ncertain their comparative value. Of\nthose that he has tried he prefers the\ncommon blood beet and the mangel\nwurtzel, [scarcity beet] but which of\nthe two be has not fully determined.\nOn the comparative value of root crops\nand Indian corn as food for swine, Capt.\nKent lias made some experiments, and\nbelieves that corn is much to be prefer\nred in fattening swine.\nThe lands of Mr. Tristram and Hen\nry Mittle, ofAewbury, were visited by\nthe Committee with much satisfaction.\nTheir field of mangel wurtzel is the fin\nest we have ever seen; and we doubt\nnot that the produce will be at least one\nthousand bushels to tbe acre\u2014equal in\nvalue to ten tons of the best of En\nglish hay.\u2014Their experiments on In\ndian corn haye heretofore been very\nsuccessful, as the premiums of this and\nthe State Society will abundantly testi\nfy. In Ihe present year, we are of the\nopinion that their field is planted quite\ntoo thick\u2014that it contains twice as ma\nny stalks as will be found profitable. It\nis planted in rows, and has several stalks\nto every square foot of land. It seems\nto be their opinion that the best mode of\nplanting corn is in hills, from three to\nfour feet apart, and with from four to\nsix stalks in a hill. Care should be tak\nen in the selection of the seed ;\u2014this\nshould be done in the field, from the fair\nest and earliest stalks;\u2014and where two\nwell ripened earsare found on one stalk,\nthey are always to be preferred as being\nmore productive. It is important that\nthe ears earliest ripe be selected,\nfor their produce will ripen earlier in\nthe succeeding year ; and hence yield a\nsafeguard against early frosts, the most\ndangerous enemy to this most valuable\nof crops. Without good seed it is vain\nto expect large products; and the little\nattention necessary to produce the best\nseed will be abundantly rewarded in the\nquality and quantify of the harvest.\nTheir field of English turnips exceeded\nany thing of the kind witnessed else\nwhere. We were informed that they\nhid raised of this crop more than six\nhundred bushels to the acre, after a crop\nof grass had been taken from the land,\nin this way may the farmer easily reme\ndy the evil consequences of a short crop\nof hay ;\u2014a few acres well cultivated\nwith turnips will fully supply all the de\nficiencies that ordinarily occur.\u2014Their\nturnij* were planted in rows about two\nfeet apart, and so thinned that the\nplants were not permitted to grow\nwithin ten or twelve inches of each oth\ner. They hoe them several times, and\ntake care that the ground is kept loose\nabout them, and free from weeds.\nThe farm of Mr. William Thurlow,\nsituate in W. Newbury, contains about\n150 acres. It is distinguished for hav\ning the largest and most productive ap\nple orchard in the county. There are\nupon it 2500 grafted trees in a beating\ncondition. Jn some seasons they have\nyielded more than 1000 barrels of sound\nand fair winter apples, worth at least\n1200 dollars. Mr. Thurlow suffers\nsheep only to teed in his orchard grounds.\nIhe limbs of his trees being low, he\ndoes not permit cattle of any descrip\ntion to go among them. He never\nploughs the land about the trees, or ap\nplies any manure to them. He prunes\nthem more or less annually. Their\nflourishing condition must be attributed\nto the peculiar adaption of the soil to\ntheir growlh, and its superior natural\nstrength and fertility. Most of Nr.\n1 hurlow\u2019s trees produce the common\nRoxbury russet apple. This is a valu\nable fruit, and pretty sure to bear ; lut\nlately other species have come into use\nmuch more valuable. Our farmers gen\nerally appear not sufficiently attentive,\nin grafting their trees, to obtain the best\nkinds ci fruit. Regard, also, should be\nhad to the character of the tree fram\nwhich the scions are takenthat it be\nthrifty, productive, and constant in bear\ning; and that it be of a kind of fruit\nthat is not on the decline, or, in the fir\nmer\u2019s phrase, nearly run out. Natural\nfruits, of trees growing from the seeds,\nare occasionally found of excellent qual\nities, either for cider or eating. These\nshould be preferred in grafting.\n[To be continued.]\nThe two Farmers.\u2014Two farmers who\nwere neighbours had their crops of ear\nly peas killed by the frost.\u2014One oftbem\ncame to condole with the other on their\nmisfortune\u2014\u201cAh!\u201d .cried he, \u201c how in\nfortnnate we have been, neighbour!

Greece, Italy,\nthe world, have lost their poet-hero;\nand his death has spread a wider gloom,\nand been recorded with a deeper awe,\nthan has waited on the obsequies of any\nof the many great who have died in\nour remembrance. Even detraction has\nbeen silent at his tomb ; and the more\ngenerous of his enemies have fallen into\nIhe rank of his mourners. But he set\nlike the sun in his glory; and his orb\nwas greatest and brightest at the last;\nfor his memory is now consecrated no\nless by freedom than genius. He prob\nably fell a mariyr to his zeal against ty\nrants. He attached himself to the cause\nof Greece, and dying clung to it with a\nconvulsive grasp, and had thus gained\na niche in her history; for whatever\nshe claims as hers, is immortal even in\ndecay, as the marble sculptures on the\ncolumns of her fallen temples.\u201d\n\u2666 Shelly and Keats.\n[From Smellie\u2019s \u201c Philosophy of Natural\nHistory.\u201d]\nTHE CAME LEON.\nTo the Cameleon has been attributed\nthe singular faculty of changing the col\nour of their skin, according to the col\nour of the substance on which they are\nplaced, and of subsisting upon air. This\nbelief has arisen from the extraordinary\ns;ze of their lungs, which they are capa\nble of distending with air to such an e\nnormous extent, as to fill nearly their\nwhole body, and render their skin some\nwhat transparent.\u2014Hence they were\nsaid to feed upon air. In this state of\ndistention and semi-transparency, the\nAkin becomes easily affected by every\nchange in the circulation ; and conse\nquently a change of colour is produced\nby the varying wants and passions of the\nanimal, which influence both the quanti\nty of respiration and the tint of the\nblood.\n[WHOLE NO. 2699.\nThe Death.

These\nsounds or beats are given in pretty quick\nsuccession, are repeated at uncertain in\ntervals, and in old houses, where the\ninsects are numerous, & may be heard at\nalmost every hour of the day\u2014espec\nially if the weather be warm.\u2019 The in\nsect is of colour so nearly resembling\nthat of decayed wood, that it may for a\nconsiderable time elude the search of\nthe inquirer.

C, June 26, \"1837.\nVr. Editor: In this District, where the\nsoil is not very rich, the planter must turn\nHis attention to ma kin;- iHii,lle\nthe soil. Already has the climate been\nchanged, by the inconsiderate custom of\nclearing lands every year; for it has\nbecome- sicklier, colder, end therefore\nless congenial to the culture of cotton. The\nsoil is light and easily, worked. And why\nshould we not avail ourselves of these ad\nvantages? .Not one planter or farmer in ten,\nthinks of manuring at all. While one will\nbe deriving fine .crops from manuring, his\nnext-door neighbor will not deign to inquire\ninto the cause. Even those who turn their\nattention to manures do not understand the\nplainest chemical elements by which they\nare to \"be regulated in its production Be\ncause it may be. beneficial to manure with\ncotton seed On top, a planter will use cow\npen and stable manure in the same way,\nas if the sun would not extract much of the\nstrength of the manure, before it could be\ncovered with the plough. Cotton seed can\nbe used on top; because, Tiefore it ferments,\nand before the sun can extract its alimentary\nproperties, it is covered in the working of\ncorn. I only mention this to show, that our\nplanters, by not thinking for themselves, are\nfrequently inconsistent. There is my neigh\nbor, Squire Suooks, who, the .moment his\nmanure arrives in the field, covers it with\ndirt, and yet he, manures his corn with it,\non lop.\nThe best planters up here adopt this plan\nof making ma nure.\nI. lne stables are lined with oak leaves,\nrotten wood, (oak best) pine trash, heaped\nin the woods for at least six months before\nused, all kinds of trash, gum pond mud, and\nlomeumes Cray, wen broken up. i nis is\ntaken out of the stables every two months, if\npossible, during a rain, heaped and covered\nwith clay or sand; if not during a rain, pour\nupon the heap, before covering it, a suffi\ncient-quantify of water to assist in fermenta\ntion. Even while the mass is in the stable,\na little water, occasionally sprinkled, with\nthe use of the grubbing-hoe at least once a\nweek, will' have a good effect. By grubbing\nwith the hoe, the animal is effectually com\nbined with the vegetable manure, and lumps\nof clay or rotten wood, are pulverized\n2. The poultry houses and yards are\ncleaned once a month, and the yield there\nfVom, thrown into the stable.\n3. All the Pride pf India berries are raked,\nand thrown into the stable.\n4. There is a. pen, six feet square, and\naix feet deep,\" below the surface, of the earth,\nfilled with leaves, and covered, into which\nthe cook and washer throw their slops and\nsuds. This is emptied at the proper time,\nheaped, and covered with trash, &,c.\n5. Hog-pens\" are ' made, six feet square,\nand six feet below the surface of the earth,\nfilled with leaves, and protected from the\nrain. The floor is made of rails, through\nthe intervals of which, the animal matter\nof the hogs is dropped. On the floor is a\nCovering of pine-trash, for beds, which the\nsharp feet of the hogs will, in a short time,\ncut into fine pieces. The hogs are either\npenned here the whole year, or sleep in them\nevery -night, or, at all events, are put up at\n'\" least one month\" to fatten', for bacon. , Ma\nnure thus made is equal to \"cotton-seed.\"\n6. Each negro is allowed Jo keep one or\ntwo hogs, on condition that they are penned,\nas above stated.\" Hogs fatten pest on wood\nen floors; and though : raw cotton-seed will\nkill them, they fatten on it when boiled with\nthe offals of the garden ana fields. xney\ndo not like cold or rain, and, : in the end, it\nwould be decidedly cheaper to pen them all\nthe year, except when they are allowed to\nrun the pea, potato, and slip fields. In the\nway I haVe described, they will make more\nmanure than the cotton seed \"they eat. Be\nsides, there is nothing safer than to have our\nhogs always in sight. - B'\n7. Cattle pens. The manure made in\nthe3e pens is. always indifferent, unless they\nbe covered. In this particular, our planters\nup here, labor under a great mistake. Their\nplan is this: Leaves and trash, thrown in\nto a pen, are trampled on by cattle, exposed\nto the weather, and, by the time the mass is\nheaped for fermentation, the best part of its\nmanuring qualities has evaporated. , On the\nother hand, when in stalls, the leaves are not\nonly trampled, but they absorb the animal\nmatter, and retain it until the manure is used1.\nA cow, when stalled, will make four times\nthe manure of a horse, in a year. Its dung\nis more susceptible of -combination with ve\ngetable matter; and, for the same reason, it\nis rendered quickly inert, by the action of\nthe sun. I have tried the difference between\ndried and fresh cow-dung, under corn. The\nformer had no effect; while Jhe latter forced\nthe corn very much. Cow pens should be\ncovered, and the cattle turned in every night.\nHowever, after all, the most profitable plan\nis to stable feed milch cows and oxen; in this\ndistrict, where we are compelled to feed cat\ntle, one half of the year, they should be fed\nwith boiled cotton-seed. That cotton-seed,\nfor corn, is superior to any manure we use,\ncannot W doubted; but, at the same time;\nwhen the improvement of cattle is consider\ned, the increase of their milk and butter, their\nprotection from theives, and the undoubted\nfact, that they can be made to produce, in\nsix months, four times more efficient manure\nthan the cotton seed they consume, I do not\nhesitate to contend, that, the better policy\nwould be, to stable-feed them on boiled cot\nton seed, for six months in the year, or during\nthe winter season. Any cow can be taught\nto eat cotton seed, by adding a little salt.\nA stall filled with leaves ctsn be emptied\nevery two months. The cow drops more\nthan the horse, and it tramples more effectu\nally it3 hoofs being sharp and wide. Ano\nther consideration is this: with cow pen ma\nnure thus mnde, land is enriched ever' time\nit is planted, and in this respect it is more\nvaluable than cotton seed. In short, to use\ncow pen manure, raked from an uncovered\npen, except lor the undecomposed vegetable\nmatter, in it, is always a useless task. In\nnine cases out of ten, it will fire the corn,\neven in a moderately wet senson. On the\ncontrary, stable manure never will; nor does\nany well fermented manure ever fire the\nplant. A gentleman in my parts has advan\nced one step towards this improvement.\nWhen the mass, in his unroofed pen, has\nbeen sulhciently trampled, h i -,;u.\nclay, and on this places another layer of\nleaves, ana so on, alternating', unui ne nas\nmade the ouantitv of manure he reouires.\nBut even this gentleman is engaged in build\ning a stable for his cows. He says, by experi\nment, 3 bushels of cotton seed per week, wiU\nfatten a cow, and 2 1-2 bushels, with shuck?,\nare enough. 50 bushels of seed, from two\nbale3 of short cotton, would enable him to\nstall-feed his cattle during the winter the\nseason when manure is made, and when cat\ntle suffer most for range. So that, after de\nducting seed for planting from everv 50\nbushels of cotton seed, he caculates to stall\nfeed one cow. He further says, that he will\nnot be able to stall-feed all his eattle, but\nthat all those not supnlied wilL.be turned\nnightly into an open pen, filled with leaves,\nwith which he will replenish the stalls when\never they may be emptied. D.\nWashing Trees. The following may\nprove a useful hint to those who arc anxious\nthat their trees should possess a beautiful ap\npearance. The llostou Cultivator recom\nmends ley from wood ashes or from potash,\nas the best wash for trees. It should not be\napplied until May or June, when it .will kill\nthe moss and all the iusects that adhere to the\nbark. There is a small insect resembling a\nlouse to be found on most young trees. - 'I hey\nnever appear to move excepting in the month\nof June, and then they ar e not great travel\nlers. The ley above named, if put on in\nJune, effectually clears the tree of this insect.\nTrue Philosophy: The Farmer. Two\nFarmers, who were neighbors, had their crops\nof early peas killed bv die frost. One of them\ncame to condole with the other on their mis-\nJbitune. \"Ah!\" cried he, 'how unfortunate\nwe have been neighbor! you seem to have\ndone nothing. But bless me! you seem to\nhave a fine heallhy crop coming up just now:\nwhat are these?\" \"1 hese,\" said the other;\n\"why, these are what I sowed immediately af\nter my loss.\" \"What coming up already?\"\ncried the fietter. \"Yes; while you were fret\nting I was working.\" \"What and don't you\nfret when you have a loss?\" \"Yes, but I al\nways put it ofTuntil I have repaired the mis\nchief.\" \"Lord! why then you've no need to\nfret at all.\" \"True,\" replied the industrious\ngardtier, \"and that's the very reason; in truth\nit is very pleasant to have no longer reason to\nthink of misfortunes; and it is astonishing how\nmany might be repaired by a little alacrity and\nenergy.\" '. .\nOTEIj.

    "WASHINGTON.\n\u201c liberty and Union, now and forever, one and\ninseparable.\u201d\nWEDNESDAY, MAY 15, 1839.\nFROM FLORIDA.\nThe subjoined article would seem to contra\ndict the statement copied in our last from a\nNew Orleans paper of the 6th instant. The\nNew Orleans statement, however, as it appears\nto have been made upon the authority of Gen.\nMacomb himself, (who must best know what has\npassed between him and the Indians,) must be\nyet relied upon until it shall appear, from the\nsame authority, that the facts of the case were\nmisunderstood there.\nFROM.THE TALLAHASSEE FLORIDIAN, MAY 4.\n\u201c A short time since, the hostile Indians under Nehe-\nStoco Matta, principal chief of the Tallahassees, with one\nhundred warriors, went into Tampa and carried off all the\nIndian prisoners at that post. They likewise returned the\nnight following, crossed the river, and reconnoitred the\npost and barracks. They refused to come in to treat with\nthe whites, and left word with a white man whom they\nheld prisoner during one night, that if General Macomb\nwished to treat with them he must come to their camp.\u201d\nThe following letter has been furnished to\nthe editors of the Philadelphia Pennsylvanian :\nEXECUTION OF THE PIRATE MARS AUD,\nAT BORDEAUX.\nCaptain Marsaud, who murdered the Captain and part\nof the crew, and took command of the French ship Alex\nandre, (which vessel was seized at Newport, Rhode Island,\nsome time since, and sent under the command of an officer\nfrom on boird a French man-of-war to Bordeaux,! has\nbeen tried, found guilty, an! executed at Bordeaux for the\nabove crime. A young man, his second officer, has also\nbeen tried and found guilty, but, on account of his age,\nhas been recommended to mercy. The execution of Mar\nsaud took place three hours after the passing of his sen\ntence. Before his death he made a full confession of all\nhis crimes. He said that seven men were \u2018l own over\nboard by his order, and that the mate of t> -ship implo\nringly begged of him only one half-hour\u2019s ..me in order\nthat he might write to, and take a last farewell of, his mo\nther, and offered him (Marsaud) the sum of 30,000 francs\nfor said half hour, but that he unmercifully denied it to\nhim.\nIl is very much wondered at, in Bordeaux, why it was\nthat the French authorities in the United States experi\nenced so much difficulty from the American magistrates in\nhaving such a monster given up. It is also stated that\nfour of the piratical crew who had a hand in the above\nmutiny and murders are still in the United States, and\nthat all the entreaties of the commander of the French\nman-of-war Bergere could not induce the Americans to\ngive them up.\nThe United States schooner Wave, under the command\nof Lieutenant M\u2019Laughlin, has rendered eminent service\nto our commerce on the Capes of Florida. This vessel\nhas saved the lives of twenty men of shipwrecked crews,\nthat would have otherwise fallen a prey to the marauding\nsavages; also, a large amount of wrecked property has\nbeen rescued, and the haunts of men who have furnished\nmunitions to the Indians have been broken up.\nA Breach in the Canal.\u2014A breach was made in the\nDelaware and Chesapeake Canal on Saturday last, at a\nportion of the works about four miles from Delaware city.\nThe injury, it is said, is so great, that it cannot be repaired\nin a shorter time than two months. Forty or fifty sail of\nvessels, laden with lumber and other articles from that city\nand Port Deposite, are now confined in the canal, or have\nbeen obliged to return up the bay or put to sea.\nJudge King, Chief Judge of the Court of Common Pleas\nin Philadelphia, a few days since, during the trial of an\ninsane negro for the. murder of a watchman, in his remarks\nto the jury, commented on the enlightened policy of pro\nviding for insane paupers at the public charge; and observ\ned, in highly complimentary terms, that Maryland had\nacquired for herself great honor by the recent liberal appro\npriation for that object.\n* Pensacola, May 4, 1839.\nThe United States sloop of war Vandalia, Capt. Levy,\narrived here on Tuesday evening last in 8 days from La\nguma Terminoz, where the Captain was detained some\ndays adjusting the difficulty between the late Consul and\nthe Mexican authorities. On the 13th the Vandalia sail\ned from Vera Cruz, leaving the Ontario at anchor. The\nFrench and English squadrons were about leaving, and\nthe city becoming settled and quiet. The loss by the fire\nwas estimated at $500,000. The flag ship, with the Eriet\nLevant, and Warrent was daily expected.\nA bunch of Asparagus from the garden of William H.\nRichardson, near Richmond, (Va.) was weighed by Mr,\nDiddep, Clerk of the Market, on Saturday morning, the\n11th inst. It contained six stalks, or spears, and weighed\none pound thirteen ounces !\u2014Whig.\nBones of a Mastodon.\u2014Our readers will recollect of\nreading some time last summer of the discovery of the\nbones of a gigantic animal in Crawford county, Ohio.\nThese bones are now in Pittsburgh, Pa. The bones of\nthe head, including a number of grinders, are in a remark\nable state of preservation; and some faint idea of what the\nliving animal was, may be formed, when we state that the\nskull and upper jaw are 3 feet 3 inches in length, and weigh\n160 lbs. the lower jaw 77 lbs.\u2014the whole head 237 lbs. of\ndry bones! There are many other bones\u2014legs, ribs, ver\ntebrae, &c. all in a good state of preservation.\u2014Pittsburg\nAdvocate.\nFROM THE SALISBURY WATCHMAN.\nExcursions.\u2014ls we were to chronicle all the interesting\npassages that are reported to us as occurring to the plea\nsure parties that go abroad from this place, we should pre\nsent a budget of fun and adventures rare. In one instance,\non a visit to the Narrows of the Yadkin, a fair one got\nfastened in the rocks, so that one of her beaus had to knock\nher out of her difficulty : another lost her stockings in an\nadventure somewhat similar, and had to walk about five\nmiles without them. On another occasion, a gentleman\nwho had the reputation of a gallant squire, undertook the\nnavigation of a canoe; but he found his craft somewhat\nunmanageable, and while going through a rapid stream,\nat the rate of ten knots, he undertook to make a short halt\nby putting down the pole immediately below it. As might\nbe expected, he took an aerial flight of some fifteen feet, and\nwas landed in the water, as Paddy would tell you. He\nwas taken up considerably down the river, and immediate\nly proposed 11 to go home.\u201d Some of the ladies showing\nan inclination to laugh at his misfortunes after the danger\nwas discovered to be over, our buck replied, with some\nshow of impatience, \u201c Well, fishing is a pleasant business,\nbut to be fished for aint quite to my liking.\u201d\nUps and Downs.\u2014We observe a striking instance of\nthe uncertain tenure of earthly goods, in a case lately re\nported in the London papers. It was a prosecution for per\njury, in the course of which it was given in evidence, that\nthe prosecutrix, Lady Parker, becoming security for her\nsister, Lady Lake, for the sum of \u00a319,000, in consequence\nof legal proceedings for its recovery, became an inmate of\nthe King\u2019s Bench Prison, where she officiated as cook to\nthe more wealthy portion of the prisoners.\u2014American.\nTrue Philosophy\u2014The Farmers.\u2014Two farmers, who\nwere neighbors, had their crops of early pease killed by the\nfrost. One of them came to condole with the other on their\nmisfortune. \u201cAh ! \u2019 cried he, \u201c how unfortunate we have been,\nneighbor ! I have done nothing but fret ever since. But, bless\nme ! you seem to have a fine healthy crop coming up just now :\nwhat are these?\u201d \u201c These,\u2019\u2019 said the other; \u201c why, these are\nwhat I sowed immediately after my loss.\u201d \u201c What, coming up\nalready ?\u201d cried the fretier. \u201c Yes ; while you were fretting I\nwas working.\u201d \u201c What! and dont you fret when you have a\nloss ? \u2019 \u201c Yes, but I always put it off until I have repaired the\nmischief.\u201d Lord ! why then you\u2019ve no need to fret at all.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d replied the industrious gardener, \u201c and that\u2019s the very\nreason ; in truth, it is very pleasant to have no longer re&son to\nthink of misfortunes; and it is astonishing how many might be\nrepaired by a little alacrity and energy.\u201d\nBordeaux, March 24, 1839.\nTHE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nThe noble stand taken by Mr. Clay, himself\na W estern man, in defence of the common right\nof the States to an equal distribution of the pro\nceeds of the public land, is, of itself, sufficient\nto challenge the admiration and gratitude of\nevery citizen of the old States. Mr. Clay has,\nin the following letter, which explains itself,\ngiven fresh evidence of his enlarged and disin\nterested views, and of his stern adherence to\nprinciple:\nGentlemen : I have duly received your letter, trans-\nRDHing certain resolutions adopted by the Democratic\nW nig Association of the Tenth Ward of the City of New\n*\u00b0l \u2019 reJat*\u00b0q to the Public Domain; and I request you to\nmake the Association my profound acknowledgments, for\nthe notice with which it has honored my name. I rejoice\nthat the People, in their primary assemblies, and in their\nproper communities, are directing their attention to this\ngreat interest. It is high time it should receive their ear\nnest consideration. Faithfully administered, the public\nlands may be made powerfully instrumental in the advance\nment of the prosperity of the present generation, and of\ntheir posterity for a long succession of ages.\nBut they have been in danger of being swept away by\npre-emptiqns, Indian reservations, graduation bills, and,\nfinally, cessions of the common property of all the States\nto the particular States in which it is situated. And most\nof these projects, urged under the plausible pretext of be\nnefiting the poor settler, have stimulated the speculator,\nand tended to aggrandize the speculation to the prejudice\nboth of the honest emigrant and the People of the United\nStates. I have felt it to be my duty to oppose these pro\njects ; and it is a deplorable evidence of the loose morality\nwhich prevails in respect to the public property, that I\nhave been denounced and calumniated for my endeavors\nto protect and preserve it for the benefit of all the States\nand People of the Union,\nI share with you, gentlemen, in regret on account of the\nfailure of the bill to distribute the nett proceeds of the pub\nlic lands, which passed both Houses of Congress. It was\ndefeated by a high-handed and daring violation of the Con\nstitution. If it had gone into operation, there would have\nbeen no extraordinary surplus in the Treasury, no distur\nbance of the financial and business concerns of the coun\ntry by a removal of the deposites, no temptation to those\nalarming annual appropriations which have been recently\nmade by the Federal Government, and, I believe, no sus\npension of specie payments by the banks. Now that the\npublic attention is awakened to this great national resource,\nI trust that project to which I have adverted will be check\ned, and that it will be cherished and preserved for the com\nmon benefit of all the People of the United States and\ntheir posterity.\nI request, gentlemen-, your acceptance of my thanks for\nthe flattering and friendly manner in which you have com\nmunicated the resolutions of the Democratic Association\nof the Tenth Ward, and of the high consideration with\nwhich\nI am your friend and obedient servant,\nHENRY CLAY.\nMessrs. Wm. Turner and J. Turner Dodge, &c.\nTHE STATES AND THE CANADAS.\nThe Canadian and American Frontiers.\u2014\nThe late report of Lord Durham on the affairs\nof Canada thus contrasts the appearance of the\nAmerican and Canadian shores :\n\u201cOn the American side, all is activity and bustle. The\nforest has been widely cleared ; every year numerous settle\nments are formed, and thousands of farms are created out\nof the waste; the country is intersected by common roads ;\ncanals and railroads are finished, or in the course of forma\ntion ; the ways of communication and transport are crowd\ned with people and enlivened by numerous carriages and\nlarge steamboats. The observer is surprised at the num\nber of vessels they contain ; while bridges, artificial land\ning places, and commodious wharves are formed in all di\nrections as soon as required.\n\u201cGood houses, warehouses, mills, inns, villages, towns,\nand even great cities, are almost seen to spring up out of\nthe desert. Every village has its school house and place\nof public worship. Every town has many of both, with its\ntownship buildings, its book stores, and probably one or\ntwo banks and newspapers; and the cities with their fine\nchurches, their great hotels, their exchanges, court-houses,\nand municipal halls of stone or marble, so new and fresh as\nto mark the recent existence of the forest where they now\nstand, would be admired in any part of the old world. On\nthe British side of the line, with the exception of a few fa\nvored spots, where some approach to American prosperity\nis apparent, all seems waste and desolate. There is but\none railroad in all British America, and that running be\ntween the St. Lawrence and Lake Champlain is only 15\nmiles long. The ancient city of Montreal, which is natu\nrally the commercial capital of the Canadas, will not bear\nthe least comparison in any respect with Buffalo, which is\na creation of yesterday.\n\u201c But it is not in the difference between the larger towns\non the two sides that we shall find the best evidence of our\nown inferiority. That painful but undeniable truth is most\nmanifest in the country districts through which the line of\nnational separation passes for 1,000 miles. There, on the\nside of both the Canadas, and also of New Brunswick and\nNova Scotia, a widely scattered population, poor, and appa\nrently unenterprising, though hardy and industrious, sepa\nrated from each other by tracts of intervening forests, with\nout towns or markets, almost without roads, living in mean\nhouses, drawing little more than a rude subsistence from\nill cultivated land, and seemingly incapable of improving\ntheir condition, present the most instructive contrast to\ntheir enterprising and thriving neighbors on the Ameri\ncan side.\u201d\nThe 11 Winter Studies and Summer Rambles\u201d\nof Mrs. Jamison has a passage to the same\neffect :\n\u201c I hardly know how to convey to you an idea of the\ndifference between the two shores; it will appear to you as\nincredible as it is to me incomprehensible. Our shore is\nsaid to be the most fertile, and has been the longest set\ntled ; but to float between them, (as I did to day in a little\ncanoe made of a hollow tree, and paddled by a half-breed\nimp of a boy,) to behold on one side a city with its towers\nand spires and animated population, with villas and hand\nsome houses stretching along the shore, and 100 vessels or\nmore, gigantic steamers, bridges, schooners, crowding the\nport, loading and unloading; all the bustle, in short, of\nprosperity and commerce; and, on the other side, a little\nstraggling hamlet, one schooner, one little wretched steam\nboat, some windmills, a catholic chapel or two, a supine\nignorant peasantry, all the symptoms of apathy, indolence,\nmistrust, hopelessness! Can anyone help wondering at\nthe difference, and ask whence it arises? There must be\na cause for it surely\u2014but what is it ? Does it lie in past or\nin present\u2014in natural or accidental circumstances? In\nthe institutions of the Government or the character of the\nPeople? Is it remediable? is it a necessity? is it a mys\ntery? What and whence is it ? Can you tell? or can you\nsend some of our colonial officials across the Atlantic, to\nbehold and solve the difficulty ?\u201d\nAsphaltum Pavements.\u2014One of the warm days of the\nweek before last the admirable asphaltum pavement in Bour\nbon street was so affected by the heat of the weather as to\nbe rendered all but impassable. Horses left the imprints of\ntheir hoofs after them in the melted substance, and the\nmarks of wheel carriages are still plainly discernible. We\nbegin to have some serious apprehensions of its running\naway in the dog days, and would advise, as a timely pre\nventive, the laying of a thicker coat of bitumen over the\nbricks, or the boiling of it down to a stiffer consistency. 4\n[ New Orleans Advertiser of theblh. April.\n[lt is evident from the above paragraph that the sub\nstance alluded to is not asphaltum\u2014at least, not mineral\nasphaltum, such as is obtained from the French mines,\nand used in France and England, as that is unaffected by\nsolar heat, and can only be softened by being subjected to\nthe heat of fire. It will remain as hard as granite under\nthe sun of the equinox.\u2014Nat. Intel.]\nDEATHS.\nIn Alexandria, D.

By order :\nmay 15 J. T. GIVEN, Secretary.\nHOME INTELLIGENCE.\nREPORTED POR THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER.\nRemoval or The City Post Office.\u2014Having, a short\ntime ago, stated, on what we then considered to be good\nauthority, that the City Post Office was not intended to be\nremoved from its present location, at the corner of Four\nand-a-half street and Louisiana avenue, it surprised us to\nlearn, a few days ago, from good authority, that it had been\nfinally determined to give up the present location, and rea\nmove the City Post Office to the cornet Of Twelfth street.\nOn the north side of Pennsylvania avenue. By reference\nto the proceedings of the Washington Corporation, pub\nlished in this day\u2019s paper, it will be seen that the contem\nplated removal of the City Post Office has been brought\nunder discussion in the two Boards, and a resolution of\nMr. Watterston passed by a very large majority in the\nBoard of Aidermen and Board of Common Council, autho\nrizing the Mayor to wait upon the President of the United\nStates and respectfully to request that the City Post Office\nmay not be removed from its present location until the\nmeeting of Congress.\nSince writing the above, we learn that Mr. Fuller has\nentered into a contract with the Postmaster General for\nthe renting of the building at the corner of Twelfth street,\nfor the new City Post Office, and that the workmen com\nmenced their operations yesterday morning. Moreover, it\nis now stated, by a person well advised on the subject, that\nit is not contemplated to locate the City Post Office in the\nnew building on Seventh street, but permanently at the\ncorner of Twelfth street and Pennsylvania avenue. It\nneeds not the gift of prophecy to foretell that Congress will\nlet the Postmaster General know whose is the controlling\nauthority in reference to this matter, his\u2019or theirs. Weare\nnot sure, indeed, that, without the intervention of Congress,\nthose whose rights of property are in the way of being in\njured by the rumored permanent removal of the City Post\nOffice from its old site, would not have a remedy against\nthe Postmaster General, under the act of Congress of\nMarch 7, 1812, (directing where the Post Office shall be\nkept,) by a process at law.\nCoroner\u2019s Inquest.\u2014On Saturday, the Hth instant,\nan inquest was held in the city of Washington, before\nThomas Woodward, Esq., Coroner of the county, upon\nview of the body of Cyrus Jackson, a slave, nearly sixty\nyears of age, the property of James Maher, of the Globe\ntavern, who had come to his death by a wound inflicted on\nhis head on the evening of the 10th instant, by which his\nskull was fractured, and of which wound he died about\nthe hour of five on the morning of the 11th instant.\nAfter a careful and patient investigation, occupying full\nfour hours, the following verdict of the jury was delivered\nby George Sweeny, Esq. foreman: \u201c That the deceased\ncame to his death by a deep wound on his head ; but how\nthe said wound was caused or inflicted, the testimony is\nnot sufficient to enable the jury to form a satisfactory\njudgment.\u201d\nDelightful Rain.\u2014On Monday last we had an abun\ndant and seasonable rain, which descended in showers\nand heavily during the day. It was accompanied in the\nevening with vivid lightning and heavy peals of thunder.\nYesterday was a delightful sunny day. The weather is\nnow, indeed, all that the gardener and husbandman can\ndesire.\nColumbian Horticultural Society.\u2014At the meeting\non Saturday last a large quantity of rare and valuable\nseeds were presented, and have been left for distribution\nwith the Treasurer, Mr. J. F. Callan. The introduction\nof foreign seeds is well calculated to improve agricultural\nproducts and, in this way, this Society has done much ser\nvice in this District. The contemplated monthly exhibitions\nwill excite an emulation among the gardeners and florists,\nwhich will be attended with the most beneficial results\u2019\nThe subjoined is copied from the Journal of the Society :\nColumbian Horticultural Society, May 10, 1839.\nAt the meeting this day the plants exhibited were of unusual\ninterest, as they were, mostof them, introduced for the first time\nto the members, and are as follows :\nBy Mr. Jas.

Editors : I was a day or two ago invited to the\nstudio of Mr. Ferdinand Pettrich, to examine the model of\na statue of General Washington, which that accomplished\nartist is about to execute, in white marble, for the city of\nWashington. A more imposing statue I never saw, and the\nlikeness, person, and costume are said to be perfect. Mr.\nPeTthicH informs me that this statue will be erected in\nthe City Hall of this city under the direction of the City\nCouncil. The cost of the statue, including the pedestal,\ncost of erection, &.c. &c., will be $5,090. He says he has\nundertaken this thing at the suggestion of some of our citi-\nZens, and that the money is to be raised by contribution.\nI am pleased at the suggestion, and have no doubt but all\nWill give something towards this noble statue of Washing\nton. I find that the Mayor and ex-Mayors of Wash\nington, and sundry other gentlemen, have already subscrib\ned. It is to be hoped that this undertaking, so creditable\nto our city and to the artist, will not be suffered to stop for\nthe want of patronage. Let all call to see it, and lam sure\nthey will be anxious for its rapid progress.\nMat 13, 1839. C.\nMessrs. Editors : Your correspondent, \u201c B,\u201d seems not\nto have read the article Bn Graveyards, to which he re\nplies, with much attention. I spoke of the other grave\nyards of the city as being comparatively \u201c but little used;\u201d\nand admitted that the description of their condition by\n\u201cG\u201d \u201c was correct.\u201d I attributed their neglected condi\ntion to that fact, and certainly meant nothing offensive\nwhen I spoke of the \"humble graves\u201d in these burial\ngrounds. There are many such graves in the burial\nground which I have attempted to describe in the commu\nnication referred to, and your correspondent must, I think,\nadmit that the graves of all who have not been distin\nguished in life may, without giving offence, be properly\ntermed humble. I have myself, like the friend he alludes\nto, wept over the humble graves of two beloved children\nsnatched from me in early life, and whose remains moulder\ninto dust in the fine burial-ground of which I have spoken,\nand have felt the truth of the beautiful lines of Males\nherbes:\n\u201cElle etoit de ce monde, ou les plus belles choses\nOnt le pire destin;\nEt Rose elle a vegue comme vivent les roses,\nL'espace d'un matin.\u201d\nBut he, like myself, may derive consolation from the\nthought that, in the language of Klopstock, they are\n\u201cSeed sown by God, to ripen for the harvest.\u201d\nI regret to say that the city authorities, which your cor\nrespondent \u201c B\u201d undertakes to censure for the want of an\n\u201c efficient police\u201d for these graveyards, have unfortunately\nnot the means to provide an efficient police for those parts\nof the city which are vastly more populous with the liv\ning, and where such a police would be much more useful.\nThey have done, perhaps, all that they deem it necessary\nto do, by appointing commissioners and sextons for the\npublic or Corporation burial-grounds of the city, in one of\nwhich (the eastern) no interments, I believe, are now made,\nor have been made for several years. It was originally\nmuch used, but, in consequence of the superior locality\nand security of the Congressional burial-ground, it has\nbeen almost entirely abandoned, and, I regret to say, is\nnow overrun with brambles and underwood\u2014very much,\nI confess, to the discredit of the Corporation.\nYour correspondent seems to have a strange conception\nof the effect of newspaper comments upon local subjects,\nand thinks that they leave no \u201c impression upon the minds\nof any but such as are individually concerned in the mat\nter\u201d commented on. This is a mistaken notion. Every\none knows the reputation our city once had for unhealthi\nness, in consequence of the false and exaggerated state\nments published concerning it. Were a citizen to under\ntake to charge the metropolis, in one of the public prints\nhere, with being the most corrupt and profligate city in the\nUnion, your correspondent would soon find that the slan\nder was not confined to Washington, but would be seized\nupon by almost every press in the United States, and cir\nculated from one extremity of the Country to the other.\nAnd I do not know that such language as the following,\nused by your correspondent, namely, \"all speak a want of\npolice and depravity of feeling that I have never seen ex\nhibited in such places in any other part of the Union,\u201d may\nnot be made a handle of by persons at a distance, to dishonor\nthe character of our city. I believe that the citizens of\nWashington are not peculiar for depravity of feeling, or\nthe neglect of their dead. The dead are not more respected\nand honored elsewhere. The living are too apt to neglect\nthose who have passed away from this world; but the\npeople of Washington cannot with justice be charged\nwith being more indifferent and neglectful in this particu\nlar than the inhabitants of other paits of the United\nStates, if we are to judge from the numerous neat vaults,\nmonuments, tombs, head-stones, and other graveyard or\nnaments of the fine burial-ground of which I have spoken,\nand with which I am astonished to learn from your corre\nspondent that probably nine tenths of this city are only ac\nquainted from \" vague and uncertain rumor.\u201d From the\ngreat number of visiters almost daily to this cemetery, both\nstrangers and citizens, I should have supposed that there\nwas not one out of fifty that had not seen as well as heard\nof it. It would indicate an ignorance and a want of curi\nosity that I should be loath to impute to the people of\nWashington. But if there be any who have never seen\nit, and who can enjoy the melancholy gratification of med\nitating among the monuments of the dead, or strolling\nthrough the walks of this garden of graves, I would ad\nvise him to remain no longer in ignorance, but to visit it\nas soon as it may be convenient, and judge for himself\nwhether the citizens of Washington are amenable to the\ncharge which both \u201c G\u201d and \u201c B\u201d have thought proper to\nbring against them. W.\nMe-srs. Editors: I would liketomake the inquiry through\nyour valuable paper, whether our Corporation intend to re\nbuild or repair the bridge over the Canal on 14th street or\nnot. If they do not, 1 would propose to the citizens to\nraise a subscription, and have one built at their expense,\nso as to prevent any further accidents, for a number of them\ndaily occur on this bridge. The writer of this article, in\ncompany with some gentlemen, was passing near this\nbridge on Sunday afternoon last, when a stranger on\nhorseback was passing over the bridge. He had proceeded\nbut half way across when his horse was caught in one of\nthe numerous holes of the bridge. lam sorry to say both\nwere very severely injured. The gentleman was very much\nbruised, and the horse (a valuable one) came nigh being\nkilled.\nThe writer of this has been induced to take notice of\nthis accident, and to give the Public caution of crossing\nthis bridge, especially at night; and if our worthy Mayor\nwere but to examine it, I have not the least doubt he would\npropose, at the next meeting of the Council, to have a new\nbridge built.

Reg.\nFeeding Horses eith Grain.-The pro\nper qtmantitV ol'ie reslective kind, is reg\nulated by weight, for in this proportion\nare the different kinds considered utirt\ntions. As for example, we give to a horse\nper day, half a bushel of oais, the weight\nof which is seventeen pounds, and if we\nwish to change to other train, as barwe.,.\nrye, or Indian corn, the same weight will\nsuffice; andi as these trains are nutch hea\nvier thtan oats a proportionate less (1ta .i.\nty by measure wil sultlice. Another rule\ndeemed important is this. that whenever\nheavier grain is substituted for oats. a\nquantity of fine cut straw should be added\nas a substittute for the husk of aie oats.\nThis induces more perlect digestion of the\ngrain.\nOats are more beneficial to horses if\nground; and hay, if chopped fine.\nTUCK iN YoUR RUFFLE.--\"We'\nfew nails to make,\" said a hhaksmith to\nhis son as lie came home from school at\n12 o'clock.

I have seen the an\npatural decay beginning upon the yet tender\nlear, and gnawing like a worm in the unopen\ned bud, while they dropped off, one by one, and\nthe scathed and ruined shaft, stood alone, until\nthe winds and rains-of many a sorrow laid that\ntoo in the dust. On one of those holy days\nwhen the patriarch, rich in virtoe as in years,\ngathered about him the great and the little ones\nof his flock\u2014his sons with their sons, and his\n- daughters with their daughters\u2014l, too, sat at\n\u2018the festive board. I, (00, pledged them in the\nsocial wine cup, and rejoiced with them round\nthe hospitable hearth ; and expatiated with de\nlight upon the eventfal future ; while the guod\n-old man warmed in the genial glow of youthful\nenthusiasm, wiped the tear-of joy from his\nglistening eye. He was happy. I met with\nthem again when the rolling year brought the\nfestive season round. But they were not all\nthere. - The kind old man sigh\u00e9d as his suffused\neye dwelt upon the then unoccupied seat. But\njoy yet came to his relief, and he was happy.\nA parent\u2019s love knows no diminution\u2014time;\ndistance, poverty, shame, but gives intensity and\n-strength to that passion before which all -others\ndissoive and melt away. Another -tlapsed.\u2014\nThe board was spread. But the guests came\nnot. The old man eried, \u00a2 Where are my\nchildren 2\u2019 And echo answered, where 72\u2014\nHis heart broke\u2014for they were not. Could\n.not heaven have spared his grey hairs this af\nfliction'? Alas ! the demon olj drunkenness had\n\u2018been there. The{ had fallen victims of his\nspell. And one short month sufficed to cast the\nveil of oblivion over the old man\u2019s sorrow and\nthe young one\u2019s shame. ;They are all dead.\nN, Y. American.\nYourn AND MANmOOD. As im the suc\ncession of the seasons, each, by the invariable\nlaws of nature, dffects the productions of what\n\u2018is next in course ; so, in human life, every pe\n-riod of our age, according as it is well \u2018or \u2018ill\nspent, influences the happiness of that which is\nto follow. Virtuous youth generally brings for-\nWa\ufb01 flourishing manbood ;\ne \u00bb uqoeu&!::m?d o b\neasiness, into resp il old--age.\nBat when nature is twned out of ts regular\ncourse, disorder takes place in the moral, just\nas in the vegetable world. If the spring put\nforth no blossoms, in summer there will be no\nbeauty, and in autumn no frait. So if youth be\ntrifled away without improvement, manhood\nwill be contemptible, and old age miserable.\u2014\nIf the beginnings of life have been vanity, its\nlatter end can be .no .other than verxation of\nspirit. :\nPowe\u00dfr or Conscience. \u2018Conscience is\nfelt to act as'the delegate of an iavisible ruler ;\n\u2018both anticipating his sentence, -and foreboding\nits execution. %Vhen the world threatens us\nwith any of its evils, we know the extent, and\ndiscern the limits of the .danger. We see the\nquarter on which.we are exposed to its attack.\nWe measure our own strength with that of our\nadversary ; and can take precautions, either for\nmaking resistance, or for contriving escape.\u2014\nBut when an awakened conscience places be\nfore the sinner the just\u201d vengeance of the Al\nmighty, the prospect is confounding, because\nthe danger is boundless. It is a dark unknown\n.which threatens him. The arm that is stretched\nover him, he can neither see nor resist. \u00a9On\nevery side he dreads it ; and on every object\nwhich surrounds him, he looks with terror, be\ncause he is constious that every object can be\nemployed against him as an instrument of\nwrath. No wonder that the lonesome solitude,\nor the midnight hour, should strike him with\nhorror. His troubled mind beholds forms,\nwhich other men see not ; and hears voices,\nwhich sound only:in the ears of guilt.\nEducation is a companion which no misfor\ntune can depress\u2014no crime can destroy\u2014no en\nemy car alienate\u2014no despotism enslave. At\nhome a friend\u2014abroad an. introduction\u2014in sol\nitude, a solace\u2014and in society an ornament.\u2014\nIt chastens vice\u2014it guides virtue\u2014it gives at\nonce grace and government:to genius. Without\nit, what is man? A splendid slave, a reason\n.ing savage !\nTue Two FARMmers. Two Farmers, who\nwere neighbors, had their crops of early peas\nkilled by the frost. One of them came to con\ndole with the other on their misfortune. < Ah!\u201d\u2019\ncried he, \u00a2 how unfortunate we have been,\nneighbor ! 1 have done nothing but fret ever\nsince. Bat, bless me ! you seem to have a fine |\nhealthy crop coming up just mow ; what are\nthese > \u00a2 These,\u2019\u2019 said the other, \u2018\u00a2 why these\nare what I sowed immediately after my loss.\u201d\u2019\n\u00a2 What coming up already ?*\u00b0 cried the fretter.\n\u00a2 Yes, while you was fretting I was working.\u201d\n\u00a2 What, and dont you {ret when you have a\nloss 2>\u2019 \u00a2 Yes, but I always patit off till I\nhave repaired the mischief.\u2019> \u00a2 X.ord, why\nthen you have no need to fret at all.\u201d\u201d \u00a2 T'rue,\u201d\nreplied the industrions farmer : \u00a2 and that\u2019s the\nvery reason ; in truth, it is very pleasant to have\nno longer reason to think of misfortune ; and it\nis astonishing how many might be repaired by a\nlittle alacrity and energy.\u201d\u2019\nGOODRICH'S GEOGRAPHY.\nOUTLINES of MODERN GEOGRAPHY\nou anew plan, carefully adapted to youth,\nwith numerous Engravings of Cities, Manners,\nCostames, and Curiosities\u2014accompanied by an\nATLAS.

Our history and the\nconstitution of Stute government should be\nmade the subject of careful study in our dis\ntrict schools, and it was with a view of effect\ning and facilitating this object that the follow\ning Catechism was compiled, and it is gratify\ning tolearn that in several places it has been in\ntroduced and used with success. It contains a\nfamiliar description of the most remarkable\nevents which have occured in New-Hamp\nshire, from the earliest arrival of the Hiltons\nand Thompson on the shores of the Pascataqua,\nand this aettlement in a barbarous and uncul\ntivated country,when there was little to charm\nthe eye and less to administer to their wants\nand nccessitics. The facts are of undoubted\n\u201cauthority, having been derived from printed\nworks of higl reputation, and from the rec\nords and manuscripts in our state archives. It\nwill be seen that a free use bas been made of 1\nBelknap's History of New. Hampshire, a work\nwhich it is hoped will be better known and\nmore read by the rising generation.\n#At the suggestion of several experienced\nteachers of yonth, there has been a revision\nof the work, and the principal answers to the\nquestions have in many cases been given in\nlanguage more simple and in an abridged form,\nwhile at the same time the relation of the cir\ncumstances necessary for the explanation ofa\ntransaction is retained, but printed in smaller\ntype. The pupil, therefore, on his first going\nthrough the book, need be required to reeite\nonly what is in the larger type, such parts of\nthe small type as may be deemed by the in\nstructor necessary to be committed to memo\nry may be learned on going through it a sec\nond time, .\n\u00a2 An abstract of the Constitution of New-\nHampshire and some new tables will be found\nin the Appendix.\u201d - .\n{l7 The following favorable notice of this\nbook, is copied from the United States Liter\nary Advertiser, published in Poston, of which\nRev.

In its investigation, I shail\nuse great plainness of speech\u2014believing that\ntruth can never conduce to _mischief, and is best\ndiscovered by plain words. 1 shall assume, as\nself-evident truths, that the liberty of a people is\nthe gift of God and nature :\u2014That liberty con\nsists in an independency upon the will of anoth\ner :\u2014That by the name of slave, we understand\na mar: who can neither dispose of his persom or\ngoods, but enjoys all at the will of his master :\u2014\nThat no man can have a right over others, unless\nit be by them granted to him :\u2014That virtue oniy\ngives a natural preference of one man above an\nother, or why one shou!d be:chosen rather than\nanother :\u2014That the creature having nothing, and\nbeing nolhin? but what the Creator makes him,\nmust owe all to him, and nothing to any one\nfrom whom he has received nothing :\u2014That that\nwhich is not just, is not law ; and that whioh is\nnot law, ought not to be in force :\u2014That he who\noppugns the public liberty , overthrows his own ;\nand is guiity of the most brutish of all follies,\nwhilst he arrogates to himself that which he de\nnies to all men :\u2014That whosoeyver grounds his\nprofessions of right upon usurpation and tyranny,\nproves himself to be an usurper and a tyrant\u2014 |\nthat is, an enemy to God and man\u2014and to have |\nno right at all :\u2014That that which was unjust in\nits beginning, can of itself never change its na- |\nture :\u2014That he who persists in doing injustice,\naggravates it, and takes upon himself all the\nguilt of his predecessors :\u2014That there is no safety \u2018\nwhere there is no strength, no strength without\nunion, no union without justice, no justice where\nfaith and truth are wanting :\u2014That the right to\nbe free is a truth planted in the hearts of men,\nand acknowledged so to be by all that have\nhearkened to the voice of nature, -and disproved\nby none but such as through wickedness, stupidi\nty, or baseness of spirit, scem to have degenerat\ned into the worst of beasts, and to have retained\nnothing of men but the outward shape, or the\nability of doing those mischiefs which they have\nlearnt from their master, the devil.\u2014Vide Ai\ngernon Sidney's Discourses on Governmeni\u2014\nthe Declaration of American Independence\u2014\u2014the\nConstitutions and Bills of Rights of the several\nStates, &ec.&c.\n1 shall spare no efforts to delineate the wither\ning influence of s'avery upon our national pros\nperity and happiness, its awful impiety, its rapid\nextension, and its inevitable consequences if it be\nsuffered to exist without hindrance. It will alse\nbe my purpose to point out the path of safety,\nand a remedy for the disease.\nThe cause of PEack and the promotion of\nTEMPERANCE, being equally dear to my heart,\nwill obtain my zealous and unequivocal support.\nMy creed, as already puplished to the worrd, is\nas follows : That war is fruitful incrime, mise\nry, revenge, murder, and every thing abomina\nble and bloody\u2014and, whether offensive or defen\nsive, is contrary to the precepts and example of\nJesus Cbrist, and to the heavenly spirit of the\ngospel ; consequently, that no professcr of Chris\ntianity should march to the battle-field, or mur\nder any of his brethren for the glory of his coun\ntry :\u2014That intemperance is a filthy habit and\nan awful scourge, wholly produced by the mod\nerate, occasional and fashionable use of alcoholic\nliquors. ; consequently, that it is sinful to distil,\nto import, to sell, to drink, or to offer such\nliquors to our friends or laborers, and that entire\nabstinence is the duty of every individual,\nI shall exercise a strict supervision over the\nproceedings of Congress, and the conduct of its\nmembers. The representatives of a moral and\nreligious people should walk circumspectly, not\nas fools but us wise men, lest they be brought to\npublic shame. This paper shall be a terror to\nevil doers, but a praise to them that do we'l.\nIn politics, no man'will doubt my republican\nism, I gofor the people\u2014the whole people\u2014\nwhatever be their bodily dim\u00e9nsious, temporal\nconditions, or shades of color. As a man of\npeuce, I am not an admirer of military men ; as\na friend to gocd government, I defrecato their\nelevation to offices ot civil trust. The proserip\ntive measures of the present administration have\nbeen such as no peorle, who do not possess the\nabject servility of slaves, can sanction or toler\nate. I shali give a dignified support to HENRY\nCLAY and the American System.\nTHE LIBERATOR AND JOURNAL OF THE\nTimes will contain a fair proportion of literary\nand miscellanecous matter\u2014all importast foreign\nand domestic news\u2014and a copious summary of\nCongressional transactions.\nI now appeal to the American people\u2014\u2014to phi\nlanlhroyisu and patriots, to moralists and ehris\ntians\u2014for adequate patronage. I believe that a\npaper of the foregoing character is specialiy\nneeded at this momentous crisis : 1 am equally\nconfident that it wi.l receive the approbation of\nall sober, reflecting, honest, humane men.

Many of them were\nboys of from nineteen to twenty years, of\nage, some of whom wero laboring under a\nhereditary taint\u2014and perhaps iu rnanv of\nthem mental deiangemenc would never\nhave been developed, had they not drunk\nof these poisoned decoctions. One boy,\nseventeen years of age, the principal support\nof a widowed mother and a little sister, was\ninduced on the Fourth day of July, 1855,\nto drink some beer, and from beer to the\nhorrible rot-gut whisky, kept in the low\ndoggeries of our city. They all gotdrunk,\nand the boy referred to, became hopelessly\nand incurably insane, and is yet in the in\nsane asylum at Dayton. . In examining the\ncase, for the purpose of getting all the an\ntecedents with it, I learned that the grand- j\nfather of the boy died iusaue. I think the I\nprobability is altogether iu favor of the idea I\nthat insanity never would have been de\nveloped in this case, had not these poison\nous admixtures acted as a powerful exci'ant\ncause. I called at a grocery store one day,\nwhere liquor is also kept. A couple of\nIrishmen came in while I was there, and\ncalled for some whisky, and the. first drank,\nand the tears flowed freely, while he at the\nsame time caught his breath like one suffo\ncated or strangling. When he could speak,\nhe says to his companion, \u201c Och, Michael,\nbut this is warming to the stomach !\u2019\u2019\nMichael drank, and went through the\nsame contortions, with the remark,\n\u201c Wouldn't it be fuiue in a cowld frhosiy\nmorning?\u201d\nAfter they had drank, I asked the land\nlord to pour me out a little in a tumbler, ia\nwhich L dipped a slip of paper, which was\nno sooner wet than it put on a scarlet hue.\nI went to my office, got my instruments\nand examined it. I fouud it had but sev\nenteen per centum of alcoholic spirits by\nweight; when it should have had forty per\ncentum to be proof, and the difference in\nper centage made up by sulphuric acid, red\npepper, petitory, custic potassa. brucine,\nand one ol the salts of Nucis Vomicae, com\nmonly called Nux Vomica. One pint of\nsuch liquor would kill the strongest man.\nEgST \u201c Going to leave, Mary ?\u201d \u201c Yes,\nmum ; I find I am very discontented.\u201d \u2014\n\u201c If there is anything I can do to make you\nmore comfortable, let me know.\u201d \u201c No,\nmum, it's impossible.

One of them,\nPenryn, nas an existence of many centuries,\nbeing recorded as a thriving market town in\n125S. The other, Falmouth, had no exis\ntence previous to the seventeenth century,\nall bough now an important seaport, and ex\nceeding its older neighbor in population and\nbusiness. Rotb towns are situated on the\nsame inlet or arm of the sea, Penryn being\nat its extreme bead. As might be expect\ned, there has existed a stroDg jealousy be\ntweeu the towns, which was not decreased\nby tleir ill-assorted uuion into one Parlia\nmentary borough, whilst still retaining their\nseparate corporate existence. Penryn con\nsidered its younger neighbor as an upstart,\nwhile Falmouth retorts by sneering at the\nolder borough, as old-fashioned, and fossili\nzed. Desperata fights and hitter personal\nquarrels have been thus occasioned.\nAbout fifteop years ago, a j\u2019ouog sailor,\nnamed Johns, a native of Penryn, belonged\nto a coasting vessel sailing between that\nport and London. He was the accepted\nsuitor of Miss Cook, a youDg girl of about\nhis own circumstances, but whose personal\nattractions gained the attention of more\nthan one man of better station. She was\nsomething of a coquette, and flirted in the\nabsence of her lover with some of her other\nadmirers.\nAmong these was a dashing young fellow, ;\na professed \u201clady killer,\u201d from Falmouth, 1\nwho had once had a quarrel with young !\nJohus, on account of local prejudice, and I\nwhose attentions to Miss Cook ware at first\nprompted by a spirit of malice to his adver\nsary. He took her to places of amusement,\nrode or walked with her on Sundays, and\nendeavored to make his attentions to her as\npublic as possibl;.\nRumors of this had reached Johns, on\nsome of his trips homo, but, as he never\n\u25a0aunt f hunt UI_\nO-;-r\u2014ksj\nwitti us little attention as possible. Once,\nhowever, Lis vessel arrived in port on a\nSunday evening, and the lovor hastily don\nned his best suit, and rushed off to see his\nlady-love. She was not at home, having\ngone to church. Impatiently ho hurried\noff to the church, and near its gate met his\napparently faithless sweetheart walking arm\nin-arm with his detested Falmouth adversa\nry. W iibout waiting to meet them, ho\ntutned and went on board his ship.\nIt wu3 tho first time when the brave\nFrankiiu was forming his expedition for the\nexploration of the Northwest Passage, and\ngreat inducements in the way of bounty\nmoney, and comparatively large pay were\nheld out to the hardy and adventurous mar- ]\nit-.ers. The two towns furnished several |\nvolunteers. Pecryn sent out four hardy '\nfellows. One of these wa3 young Johns.\u2014\nStung with the seemiDg faithlessness of his\nbeloved, he had joined the daring party that ]\nwere to seek fame, and perhaps death, amid\nthe unknown terrors of the North Pole.\nSoon after this rash step had been taken,\nJohns learned that Mbs Cook was still ^\nfaithful to him alone. The meeting between\nthem must have been both sweet and bitter\n\u2014sweet in the knowledge of each other\u2019s\nconstancy\u2014hitter in the certainty that they\nmust, part, for it was no .v too late to retract,\nldven if it were possible to withdraw from\nthis service under government, manly hon\nor forbade a cowardly desertion of the\ntownsmen who had volunteered with him ;\nnor would he care to face the jeers of the\npeople of the rival town. Besides, there\nwas u strong hope of a speedy return, and\nthe girl was somewhat, proud, after all,' of\nhis bravery, and the honor which this dar\ning step would attach to his name.\nOn a bright May morning they were mar\nried in the old church of St. Gluvia9, and a\nmerry pea! rang from the square grey tower\nin honor of the nuptials, for Johns was a\nfavorite with very many of tho townspeople,\nind the bride was, as we said, somewhat of\ni belle of the dace. Tho honevmoon was\njf but a few days'duration, for the volun\nteers were soon ordered to j oin their ships.\nOn the 23d of May, 1845, the Erebus\nmd Terror sailed from the river Thames,\nwith 135 souls on board. On the 20th of\nJuly, in that year, the whaling ship Princo\nt>f VV'ales, spoke them at the entrance of\nLancaster Sound. That was the last time\nthe members of the expedition were seen by\ncivilized men.\nThe wives of the explorers monthly drew\nhalf the pay of their husbands. The other\nhalf accumulated in the hands of the gov\nernment, until the return of their husbands,\n>r the official notification of their deaths.\u2014\nMrs. Johns drew her pay and lived at home\nwith her parents, eagerly looking for ac\ncounts of the progress of the expedition.\u2014\nIn time she became the mother of a boy,\nmd iu her new duties she passed the time\nless heavily.\nMonths rolled on to years, but still no\ntidings came of the fated vessels. Expedi\ntion after expedition went in search of the\nmissing men, but always returned with the\nsame story of privation, danger, and want\nof suooess. With painful eagerness, the\nanxious watcher grasped the weekly London\nnewspaper, in search of news of the lost\noues, and earnestly sought the opinions of\nskilful navigators, as to tho chance of their\nsafety. Hope at last seemingly died out in\nall hearts but hers. She elung to the last\nstraw.\nThose who climbed the steep of Penden\nnis Castle, eight or nine years since, may\nhave seen on Sunday afternoons a comely\nwoman, clad in plain but neat dress, seated\ndu an embrasure of a Channel, waiting and\nwatching for the vessel that never came.\u2014\nHer little boy skipped about, picking the\ndaisies and buttercups that spangled the\nglossy slopes.\nAt length hope died out of all hearts,\ne ven hors. But still she lived on her quiet\nlife. The visits to the heights were no Ion\nger made, but friends saw that tho abseo\none lived in h\u00abr thoughts. Then eame tb<\ntidings brought by Pr. Rae, convincing\nevery one that tho sad drama oft life hac\nactually been played out on those everlast\ning ice-fields. Government, which had con\ntiuued to pay the bereaved wives, was nov\ncompelled to officially announce the explo\nrers as dead. The half-pay which had ae\ncumulated in its coffers, was now paid ovoi\nto the representatives of the deceased, and\nfuture pay was stopped. To Mrs. Johns\nthe sum paid over amounted to about \u00a310(\nj sterling.\nNow, at last, the widow\u2019s words were pul\non, and the fatherless lad was dressed it\nmourning. When we last heard of them \u2014\nabout a year since\u2014they were still living\nin their native town, pursuing theold course\nof life. The widow eked out her little fund\nby sewing, and remained still constant to\nher first love.\nWhether the husband, who had seen but\na few days of wedded life, and who had\nnever seen or heard of his son, was one ol\nthe twenty-four who had died previous to\nApril 2o\u2018.h, 1848, or had participated in\nthat terrible march to death, in search of\nthe Great Fish River, we Cannot now say.\nTire receptiou of the full details of the news\nbrought by the Fox, may throw some light\non that matter. Of this we are confident,\nthat Johns did his duty to the last, and died\nas a brave man should die. There are\nthose here who know him well, and pay\nthis last tribute to the memory of an old\nfriend.\nSNOBBISH HIGH LIFE.\nTho country is running wild. Extrava\ngance, folly and fraud am the grgat pre\nvailing vices of the times\u2014the grand ehar\nac'.eristics of the age. It is manifested\nmore or less in our cities, and its influence\nis seen in the debasement of men and wo\nmen and the complete ruin of children.\u2014\nEvery successful speculator or fortunate\noperator must imitate, and if possible excel,\nhis lucky neighbor, the banker, or the mo\nnflv.molrinof rvwnnnw \u2022 ,1 4-r. .4 ~ i - a 1. ..\n- n C3 ~-7 -*\nmarble and saiin, the rosewood and silver,\nare all introduced without regard to ex\npense, extravagant carriages arc kept, with\nhorses to match, and parties are given where\nBrussels and Wilton outvie in th?ir color\nthe silks and the wine which make up the\nchief part of the entertainment. Up it\ngoes into the air, a huge pile, or a fantas\ntic residence, but not a loom in it for the\ncomfort of the owner or family\u2014all of it\nfor show and the public gaze. The women\nflaunt about in lace or laziness, or recline\nupon solt cushions in carriages, neither\nknowing or caring whether the money that\nkeeps them up he stolen or honestly gain\ned. They are happy in the mere fiict that\nthey can dash as much as the richest of\ntheir neighbors.\nFor an American of fortune\u2014real, solid\nfortune\u2014to dash into all this extravagance,\nis folly ; but that man is guilty of down\nright wickedness, who, upon a little money,\ngoes to vast and foolish expense ; for he\nmust rob somebody to carry out his plau.s ;\nor if he has enough to warrant it, his chil\ndren, when his fortune is divided among\nthem, will have all the silly and extrava\ngant notions of (heir father, without his\nmoney to give them reality. Out of all\nthis miserable life, there springs evils worse\nlhan bankruptcy. The sins of the father\nire visited upon the children unto the third\ngeneration. Of what use to society are the\nchildren of such people? Sons who are\neducated to believe all this splendor consti\ntutes the best of life, and that fast horses\nind champagne are emblematic of high life.\nDaughters brought up by silly, ridiculous\nmothers, who glories in her curtains and\nher carpets, her carriage and her parties,\nind the fashionable training of her cliil\ndren.\nNice creatures, these, for a life-battle in\ni world where energy and industry and en\ndurance are worth to them more than all\nthe airs, graces and style that they learned\nin the paternal drawing room, or'Trom for\neign masters. Out of this struggle, to ex\ncel in this sort of life, thero springs, too,\nfraud and chicanery, and all manner of\ncrime, for in the contest, gold is the end\nind aim of all\u2014the means are not ie\"ard\nill. liie sensible part ot the community\nlaugh at this folly, and laugh loudly, too,\nat coarse vulgarity parading itself in gay\nequipages, and moving about with all the\nrirs and affectations of snobbish high life\npeople elevated above their fellows bv a\nstock operation, or a rise in town lots, and\nrejoicing thereafter in flashy and in gaudy\nhouses.\nIf they made fools of themselves alone,\nit would all be proper enough. But the\neffect upon their families, and upon socie\nty, is most to be dreaded.\nIn a country whore the law divides\namong a man\u2019s heirs all his estates after\ndeath, unless disposed of by will, and where\nthe chances are that the property will net\nremain in the family beyond the second\ngeneration, it is utter folly to build palaces\nto live in\u2014far better would it be to expend\nthe same money in building schools, or\nfounding asylums, the benefit of which the\nrich man\u2019s heirs may need.

I had got it to try an ex\nperiment on some poor land, that lay off a\ncouple of miles from my bouse. I suppose\nka man ought to apologise for owning land so\nfar from home, for it is ccrtaiuly very bad\nhusbandry. The expense of cultivating it\nis nearly double that of a home lot, and\nmanuring with stable dung at that distance\nis out of the question. The fact is, the land\nbelongs to Mrs. Bunker, and, as it came\nfrom her father, she never felt like selling\nit. It has been used for pasture ever since\ni can remeniDcr. Dor the last ten years .I\nLave not been very particular about pastur\ning it, for there was not much grass there\nto be eaten. It was miserable old plain\nland, and had once been a light sandy loam,\nbefore the loam was carried off in orop3. It\nbore five-fingers and moss pretty well, was\nfair for pennyroyal, and famous for mullens\nand sweet fern. The sheep had worn little\npaths around among these brush, and if\nsheep have any virtue to restore exhausted\nland, that field never found it out. I sup\npose all the vegetable matter that grew upon\nan acre, if it could have been gathered,\nwould not have weighed two hundred pounds.\nIt used to be said of it, that it wor too poor\nto bear worms and insects, so that skunks\nhad to starve or emigrate.\nWe have a great deal of such land in all\nthe old States, thoroughly worn out, and\nnot paying the interest on three dollars an\naere, to their present owners. They are gen\nerally farmers in moderate circumstances,\nand have no spare capital to give sueli\nland a start, and it lios idle and worthless.\nI thought it was worth trying to give this\nout lot a chance to do a little better by itself\nand its owner. My plan was to turn in\ngreen crop3, a process in husbandry thit no\none practiocs in this neighborhood, I had\nread of it in my Agriculturist, and thought\nit was just the iLing for lots too far off from\nthe barn to be manured from the stable._\nThe trouble was to get the green crop to\nturn under.\nI thought the guano would probably start\nrye, and with this I could make a beginning.\nI plowed up five acres two years ago in Oc\ntober, and put on five bags of guano, or a\nbout one hundred and fifty pounds to the\nacre. The rye came up well, and looked a\nremarkably dark green, and by the time\nsnow fell, the ground was well ooverad with\na thick mat of rye. That rye made a good\ndeal of talk, and even on Sunday it used to\nbe discussed between meetings, when folks\nought to have been thinking on other mat\nters. It passed the Wintai well, got a good\nstart in the Spring, and by the middle of\n!\\T:lW flan iinorle knrrin f rt nnnonM T*. \u2014 I_-1\n- -L'L\nthick, and was thought to be one of the best i\nlooking pieces of rye in town. It went\nagaiust the grain amazingly to turn it under,\nfor according to the look, I should have had\nfifteen bushels to the acre.\nAbout the middle of June, John and I\nwent into it, with two teams, to plow it un\nder; for I had made my plan, and was not\nto be turned aside by the talk of my neigh\nbors. Tucker and Jones said it was a great\nshame to spoil such a field of grain, aod ev\nen Mr. Spooner remarked, that making ma\nnure of bread stuff, did not seem to bo very\ngood economy. Now, you see, I did not\ncare so much what George Washington Tuck\ner and Benjamin Franklin Jones said, but I\ndid not like to bs undervalued by the minis\nter. So said I to Mr. Spooner: \u201cA thing\nalways looks homely until it is finished; and\nyou just wait till I get through with this\nfield, before you make up your mind.\u201d\nThe rye was plowed under, and the ground\nturned up^bont two inches deeper than ev\ner before. In about a fortnight I sowed\nbuckwheat, harrowing it in with about the\nsame quantity of guano, that I bad used in\nthe rye. The buckwheat came up and grew\nmore rankly than anything I ever saw be\nfore. All the neighbors were astonished\nat the monstrous growth, and most astonish\ned when I brought out the teams, the last\nof August, to turn it under. They said Tim\nBunker must be crazy to make manure of the\nheaviest crop of buckwheat in town. But\nthe buckwheat went under notwithstanding.\nThe last of September I sowed with rye\nagain, and as I had put two green crops un\nder tho sod, I thought the land had got start\nenough to take care of itself. I sowed with\nthe rye, clover and hord-grass seed, calcu\nlating that these would take the ground\nwhen the rye came off. Last July I har\nvested from that five acre field, one hundred\nand twenty-five bushels of rye worth as ma\nny dollars. They have got to making pa\nper out of the straw, so that I got ten dollars\na tun for that or about seventy-fivo dollars.\nNow, every man who is used to ciphering\ncan tell whether the operation paid or not.\nThe crop, I consider worth two buudred dol\nlars, to say nothing of the Boo catch of gras#\nwhich now promises at )ea.,t a tun and a\nhalf of hay to tLe acre. The cost of the ma\nnure was about forty-five dollars. The la\nbor of plowing, sowing, harvesting, and the\ngrass seed would, perhaps, swell the cost of\nthe improvement to one hundred and fi ty\ndollars. 1 his leaves a handsome sum on the\nright side of the balance sheet, aud the laud\nin a much better condition. The old plain\nwould have been well sold at five dollars an\nacre, for it did not pay the interest on half\nthat sura. I should not want to soil now at\nten dollars an acre. TLe experiment Las\nworked much better than I thought it would.\nNow, I think we have here a bint as to\nthe economical way cf giving land a start.\nIf it lie# near the barn, wLere manure can\nbe carted cheaply, tho stable manure is tbo\nbest renovator. If it lies at a distance it\ncan be done with Peruvian No. 1, and green\ncrops, and it is much better to do it with\nthis, than to have it lie idle. Mrs. Bunker\nis as much pleased with the result as any\nbody for she says \u201cit has always distressed\nher to have any thing belonging to the Bun\nker family lyiug idle.\u201d\nYours to command,\nTIMOTHY BUNKER, Es<i.\nHookcrlown, Dec. 10, 1850.\nA Remarkabb Miser.\nt Michael Baird, who lived near Little\nYork, Pennsylvania, and died there recent\nly, was a miserable miser. Ilis father left\na valuable farm of 500 acres in the vicinity\nof iork, with some farming and household\narticles. Michael kept tavern a number of\nyears\u2014married and raised four children._\nHe accumulated an immense estate, which\nhe reserved so tenaciously that he never af\nforded a dollar for the education of his\nchildren. He was never known to lay out\none dollar in cash for any article he need\ned; he would either do without it, or find\nsome person who would barter with him for\nsomething which he could not conveniently\nsell for money. Ho farmed largely and\nkept a large distillery, which lie supplied\nentirely with his own erain. He kent. .i\nteam for the conveyance of his whiskey to\nBaltimore, where, when he could not sell\nfor money to suit him, he bartered for ne\ncessaries for his family and tavern. In this\nway he amassed an cstato worth $100,000.\nSuch wa3 his attachment to money that he\nwas never known to credit a single dollar\nto any man. Upon tho best mortgage as\nsecurity that could be given he would not\nlend a cent. He never vested a dollar in\n\u25a0 public funds, neither would he keep the\nnotes of any bank longer than he could get\nthem changed. He deposited his specie in\na large iron chest, ui\\til ic would hold no\nmore. He then provided a strong iron\nhooped barrel, which he also tilled, After\nhi; death his strong boxes yielded \u00a7250,000\nin gold and silver.\nThe cause of his death was as remarka\nble a3 the course of his life. A gentleman\nfrom Virginia offered him $12 a bushel for\n110 bushels of eloverseei, but ho would\nnot do it for less than jj 13, and they did\nnot agree. The soed was afterwards sent\nto Philadelphia, where it was sold for $7\nper bushel, and brought in the whole $550\nless than the Virginian had offered for it.\nOn receiving an account of his sale, he\nwalked through his farm, went to his dis\ntillery, and gave directions to his people;\nhe then went to his wagon house and hung\nhimself.\nCROCKETT OUTDONE.\n\u201c Turkeys used to be very plenty here in\nIndiana,\u201d said the old Major.* \u201c i\u2019ve seen\n\u2019em so thick you couldn\u2019t hardly get about\nfor \u2019em. They kept the ground scratched\nup so meller that a feller would sink knee\ndeep into it. You needu\u2019t to laugh, for I\ncan prove every word of it. To let you\nknow how thick they were, i\u2019ll just tell you\nwhat l did once. I started out one night\nto kill some turkeys, but before I got very\nfar I found that I had but one bullet with\nme, except the one in my gun. Thinks I\nmis is a Daa jod, Dut i ll uo the best i can\nwith \u2019em. So I goes on, and I see3 a great\nmany fine looking turkeys, but they warn\u2019t\nfixed to suit me. At last I sees about fifty\nsittin\u2019 all along side by side on one straight\nlimb, so I slips along under \u2019em and scores\naway, and what do you think ?\u201d\n\u201c Expect you killed two at one shot,\u201d\nsaid several of the listeners.\n\u201c No sir, I didn\u2019t shoot at \u2019em. I split\nthe limb that they were sittin\u2019 on, it open\ned, their legs slipped through, it slapped to\ngether again, and I had \u2019em all trapped. I\nthen loaded my gun with ibe other bullet,\nblazed away, and shot the limb olf clo38 to\nto the. tree. Down they came a flutterin\u2019\nand a floppin\u2019, and I shouldered the limb\nand carried \u2019em all home.\u201d\nA Good Test.\u2014The rule of the road is\na very good test of the difference between a\ngentleman and a blaokguard. Whenever\nwo meet a man, whether in a carriage or\nwith ox-team, who gives us more than half\nthe road, we respect him as a gentlemau.\u2014\nBut whenever we meet a young man who\ndrives rapidly oo, without giving an inch\nof the road, we pity him a? a poor misera\nble fellow. The same test may be applied\nto pedestrians on the paveoiants, whore\nladies are frequently and rudely jostled by\nwell dressed blackguards.\nMrs. Partington says that nothing despi\nses her so much, as .to see people \"'who pro\nfess to expeot salvation, to go to church\nwithout their purses,, when a recollection is\nto be taken.\nAn Answer.\u2014The Rev. Dr. Mason, of\nNew York, passing up Broadway, stopped\nto read a theatrioal placard, which attraoted\nhis attention.
