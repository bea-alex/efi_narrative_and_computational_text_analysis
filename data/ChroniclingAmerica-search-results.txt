By admitting the stranger\nIndisciiminately to the exercise of those high attributes\nwhich constitute the rights of the native born American\ncitizen, we weaken the attachment of the native, and\ngain naught but the sordid allegia ce of the foreigner.\nThe rights of the American, which he holds under the\nConstitution of the Revolution, and exercised by him\nas the glorious prerogative of his birth, are calculated to\nstimulate to action, condense to strength, a cement in\nsentiment and patriotic sympathy.\nBasing, then, the right and duty to confederate on these\nhigh truths, we profess no other object than the promotion\nof our native country in all the walks of private honor,\npublic credit, and national independence; and therefore\nwe maintain the right, in its most extended form, ot the\nnative born American, and he only, to exercise the vari\nous duties incident to the ramifications of the laws, exec\nutive, legislative, or ministerial, from the highest to the\nlowest post of the Government?and to obtain this great\nend, we shall advocate the entire repeal of the naturalisa\ntion laws by Congress. Aware that the Constitution for\nbids, and even if it did not, we have no wish to establish.\nexpost facto laws : the action we seek with regard to the\nlaws of naturalization, is intended to act in - prospective\ncharacter. U e shall advocate equal liberty to all who\nwere born equally free ; to be so born, constitutes, when\nconnected with moral qualities, in our minds, the aristoc\nracy of human nature. Acting under these generic prin\nciples, we further hold that, to be a permanent people\nwe must be a united one, bound together by sympathies,\nthe result of a common political organ; and to be national,\nwe must cherish the iVative American sentiment, to the\nentire and radical exclusion of foreign opinions and doc\ntrines introduced by foreign paupers and European poli\ntical adventurers. From Kings our gallant forefathers\nwon their liberties?the slaves of Kings shall not win\nthern back again.\nReligiously entertaining these sentiments, we as so\nlemnly believe that the day has arrived, when the Ameri\ncans should unite as brothers to sustain The strength and\npurity of their political institutions. We have reached\nthat critical period foreseen and prophesied by some of\nthe clear-si?hted apostles of freedom, when danger threat\nens from every ship that floats on the ocean to our shores\n?when every wind that blows walls the ragged paupers\nto our cities, bearing in their own persons and characters\nthe elements of degradation and disorder. To prevent\nth'-fe evils, we are now called upon to unite our energies.\nTo fight over this great moral revolution, the shallow of\nour first revolt of glory, will be the duty of the sons of\nthese wars, and we must go into the combat determined\nto abide by our country ; to preserve her honor free from\ncontagion; and her character as a separate people, high\nand above the engiaftment of monarchical despotisms.\nARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION.\nFirst. We bind ourselves to co-operate, by all lawful\nmeans, with our fellow native citizens in the United\nStates to procure a repeal of the naturalization laws.\nSecond. We will use all proper and reasonable exer\ntions to exclude foreigners from enjoying the emoluments\nor honors of office, whether under the General qr State\nGovernment7.\nThird. That we will not hold him guiltless of his coun\nry's wrong, who, having the power, shall place a foreign\ner in office while there is a competent native willing to\naccept.\nFourth. That we will not. in any form or manner, con\nnect ourselves with the general or local politics of the\ncountry, nor aid, nor be trie means of aiding, the cause\nof any politician or party whatsoever, but will exclusive\nly advocate, stand to, and be a sepaiate and independent\nparty of native Americans, lor the cause ot the country,\nand upon the principles as set loith in the above pream\nble and these articles.\nFifth. That we will not, in any manner whatever, con\nnect ourselves, or be connected, with any religious sect\nor denomination : leaving every creed to its own strength,\nand every ui.m untrammelled in his own faith ; adhe.ing,\nfor ourselves, to the sale cause of the natives, the es\ntablishment of a national character, and the peipetuity of\nour institutions, through the mean? of our own countrymen.\nSixth.

We learn Iroin the Gleave\nland Observer, that the wildest and most awful\nforms of this delusion are found in several places\non the Western Reserve.?The Ravenna Star\nthus speakes of this monstrous evil:\nOf all the absurd, profane, and loathsome doc\ntrines of the present day, that of modern Per\nfectionism, in its results at least, must bare away\nthe palm. It sets itself above all the obligations\nof law and order, abrogates the conjugal tie, and\nlaughs to scorn all the deccnies and proprieties of\ndomestic life.?Notwithstanding its blasphemous\nabsurdities, it has got foothold in this country,\nand in several places on the reserve.\nMead, the apostle and high priest of Perfec\ntionism, who has been operating iu this region,\nwas a short time since committed to jail in this\ncounty, on the charge of adultery, but was bai\nled out in a few days by one of his prosolytes.\nWe understand that he is now confined iu Geau\nga county jail on a similar charge. After hav\ning turned their heads with his hypoeiitical cant,\nhe seduces his victims, under pretence of spir\nitual marriagei\nThe most horrible state ot things is thus in\ntroduced into the domestic scenes of many fam\nilies, whose peace and happiness, when they\nagain come to their sober senses, will be gone\nforever.

II there\nis any power in the laws, we hope it will be ap\nplied to its lull extent.\nAn idle fellow the other day complained bit\nterly of his hard lot, and said that he was born\n.11 the last day of the year, the last day of the\nnonth, and the last day of the week, and lie\nAad always been behindhand. He believed it\n.vould have been a hundred dollars iu his pock\net if he had uot bceu born at all.\nFear.? Ttit* most distressing and irrational ef\nfects on the powers of man, but more particul r\nly of woman, are sometimes produced by tear?\nit predisposes the body to contagious disorders,\ninduces cowardice where nothing should be\ndreaded, and under circumstances of great ex\ncitement closes up the understanding, leaving\nthe individual who becomes a prey to it an idiot\nfor the remainder of a miserable existence. It\nis no less extraordinary than true, that fear ari\nsing from evident danger is less subduing than\nwhen produced by the powers of imagination.\nThere are numerous occupations, surrounded b.\nterrors, which lose their effect upon the mind by\nthe frequency of recurrence. The pursuits of\nthe seaman, the miner and others, for instance,\nprove, that on hearts accustomed to look danger\nin the face, fear exercises no overwhelming pow\ners,- because the senses being first to discover th\ndanger, its elfect is proportionate to the experi\neuce or intimacy with the cause. Ignorance is\na cause of astonishment, and darkness heightens\nthe effect of fear, only because the senses can\nnot act in conjunc tion with the understanding.\nIf light be cast on the scene, the alarming ob\njects, if there beany, are seen, and resistance is\ncalculated accordingly. That there are gradua\ntions of personal couarge, is as true as that there\nare various degrees of strength in man?but tim\nid persons, however they may have become so,\nhave objects of terror ever ready to destroy thei r\npowers of discernment. If an individual be\nselected, possessed of health, moral courage and\nexperience, in all cases of alarm his physical\npowers assist his mental energies and he is not\neasily subdued : at least, there certainly will be\nno evident prostration of his understanding.\nThe cause of yielding to imaginary terrors, per\nhaps, may be traced through a morbid state of\nthe nervous system, and an igriorance of the law\nof nature, up to tales of supernatural appearan\nces recited in the nursery, the effect of which\nis a mental slavery, from which there is no re\nlief. but in the examination of cause and effect\nin nature.as leading to knowledge of nature'sGod,\nwhere there will be found so much to fill the\nmind with satisfaction and thankluluess, that there\nwill be no room for imaginary terrors, nothing to\ndread, save doing wrong. Conscious in its integ\nrity, the mind is always unconquerable.?New\nYork Sun.\nTrue Philosophy.?The Farmers.?Two far\nmers, who were neighbors, had their crops of\nearly peas killed by the frost. One of them\ncame to condole with the other on their misfor\ntune. \" Ah !\" cried lie, \" how unfortunate ? e\nhave been, neighbor ! I have done nothing but\nfret ever since. But, dear me ! you- seem to\nhave a fine healthy crop coming up just now:\nwhat are these?\" \" These,\" said the other?\n\" why, these are what I sowed immediately after\nmy loss.\" \" What, coming up already ?\" cried\nthe fretter. \" Yes, while you were fretting I\nwas working.\" \"Whit! and donrt you fret\nwhen you have a loss?\" \" Yes, but I always\nput i' off until I have repaired the mischief.\"\n' Why then you've no need to fret at all.\"\n\" True,\" replied the industrious gardener, \"aod\nthat's the very reason; in truth, it is very pleasant\nto have no longer reason to think of misfortune;\nand it is astonishing how many might be repair\ned by a little alacrity and energy.\"\nTemperance vs. Rum.?It is stated in the Lew\nisburg (Pa.) Advocate, that some workmen in\na field of Mr. Brown of that viciuiy, lately af\nforded a very satisfactory demonstration of the\ncomparative merits, amongst those engaged in\nhard labor, of the \"abstinence\" and 'ardent\nspirits\" systems. The Advocate says one day\nlast week. Mr. Brown hired lour men to mow a\nfield ol grass. Three of them took several 'goodr'\ndrinks in the course of the forenoon and the\nfourth did, not taste a drop, whereupon, a ques\ntion arose about the utility of a \"drain,\" which\nafter having argued to no purpose for some time,\nthey agreed to decide by a contest of speed, and\nto work they went. The result was, that the\nindividual who drank nothing \"mowed round\"\nhis stimulated opponents in the course of one\n\" through across the field,\" as mowers say.?\nBait.

His head\nrested on the shoulder of h'rs parent, whose aged\narm feebly, yet fondly encircled his neek. That\nbrow 011 which fame had wreathed the purest\nlaurel virtue ever gave to created man, relaxed\nfrom its lofty bearing. That look which could\nhave awed a Roman Senate, in its Fabrician\ndav, was bent in filial tenderness upon the time\nworn features of this venerable matron.\nThe great man wept. A thousand recollec\ntions crowded upon his mind, as memory, retra\ncing scenes long past, carried him back to his\npaternal mansion, and the days of his youth ?\nand there the centre of attraction was his moth\ner, whose care, instruction, and discipline, had\nprepared him to reach the topmost height of\nlaudable ambition; yet how were his glories\nforgotten while he gazed upon her from whom,\nwasted by time and malady, he must soon part\n11 meet no more !\nThe matron's predictions were true. The\ndisease which had so long preyed upon her\nframe, completed its triumph, and she expired\nit the age of eighty-five, confiding in the proiti\nses of immortality to the humble believer.\nSeveral large failures have recently occurred\nit N'*w Orleans, amounting it is said, to aboul\none million of dollars.\nALLEGORY.\nThey grew in beauty, side by side, those two\nlovely flowers; I fanc\\ ! see them even now, as\nin tho?.e happy days, when together they waved\nin the summer breezes, or drank alike in the\ndews of heaven: the same refreshing showers\ninvigorated each, and they loved each other?\nthose gentle flowers, beautiful as wanderers Irom\nEden.

But oh! the vanity of\nearthly things' the rivulet was fickle, and it soon\nwent rippling off in another direction, and no\nlonger gladdened the heart of the lonely flower.\nAgain it drooped, and never flourished again;?\nere the summer wiuds were gone, they sighed a\nrequium over the spot where had bloomed and\nperished so lovely but ill fated flower.\nIt is comparatively easy to submit to thechas\"\ntening hand of our Heavenly Father when He\nremoves our friends by death, for there is a mel\nancholy pleasure in reflecting that their hearts\nthrobbed with affection fur *?, until the last link\nwas severed which bound the sowing spiiit to\nearth; but there is no pang more bitter than th?t\nof feeling those we love, though living, are dead\nto us.?Saturday Courier.\nQuarrels.?One of the most easy, the most\ncommon, most perfectly foolish things in the\nworld, is?to quarrel, no matter with whom,\nman, woman or child, or upon what pretence,\nprovocation or occasion whatsoever.?There is\nno kind of necessity for it, no manner of use in\nit, and 110 species or degree of benefit to be gained\nby it, and yet, strange as the fact may be, theolo\ng aus qu irrel, and politicians, lawyers doctors and\nprinces quarrel, the Church quarrels, aad the\nState quarrels, nations and tribes, and corpora\ntions, men, women and children, dogs and cats,,\nbirds ami beasts quarrel about all manner of oc\ncasions. If there is any thing in the world that\nwill make a man leel bad, except pinching his\nfingers in the crack of the door, it is- unquestion\nably a quarrel. No mau ever fails-to think- less\nof himself after than he did before one ; it de\ngrades him in his own eyes, and in the eyes of\nothers, and what is worse, blunts his sensibility\nto disgrace on the one hand, and increases the\npower of passionate irritability on.the other.?\nThe truth is, the more quietly and peaceably we\nall get on the. better?the better for ourselves, the\nbetter for our neighbors. In nine cases out of\nten the wisest course is, if a mm cheats yoir, to\nquit dealing with, if he is abusive quit his com\npany, if he slaitders you take care to live so that\nnobody will believe him. No matter who he\nis, or how he misuses you,-the wisest way is gen\nerally just to let him alone, for there is nothing\nbetter than this cool, calm, quiet way of dealing\nwith the wrongs we meet with.\nBeautiful Extract.?The following beautiful\nextract is from Gallagher's Hesperian, a rnouth\nly publication, issued in Cincinnati, Ohio:\n\" Young womanhood !

The period which\nwas supposed to justily this cruel mea\nsure has long since passed, and the be\nnignant spirit of an enlightened age, re\ngards with equal abhorrence, the injus\nlic; of the mandate that now strips the\ndebtor of his liberty, and that which se\nvered his body, and gave to each creditor\nhis proportioned share.\u2014The State is in\njured, for it loses the efforts of a useful\ncitizen. The creditor is not benefited ;\nfor the imprisonment of his debtor will\nnot satisfy his claim. The debtor is the\ndouble victim of bis misfortune and re\nvenge. If fraud is committed punish it\nby severe enactment: if concealment be\nperpetrated, expose the perpetrators to\ninfamous privations.

They burst into the house, \u00bbnd it\npossible into the very chamber of the suffer.\n\u00abr; crowd about the couch, gasing with use\nless curiosity; whisper ominous prognostica\ntions intermeddle with the a'tendants or the\nphysician; gather details enough for a gossip\ning bulletin; and then fly oh with all imigina.\nLie celerity and gratification to tattV and re\ntad the matter (mm house to house.

People\nwho imagine themselves to be performing\nacts of disinterested benevolence by their\nfrequent visits to the sick for the tmre pur\npose of asking questions, may rest assured\nthat they cannot perpetrate greater deeds of cru\nelty. They are like certain birds of prey which\nwe have seen in South Carolina, surrounding a\nfamished and perishing horse, and attempting to\npluck out his eyes before they are yet closed\nforever!\nWhat sight can be more disheartening to a\ndiseased person, than, when awakening front\nsome hideous dream, which usually accompa.\nnics bodily disorder, to behold a throng of\ndismal countenances filled with anxious ex\npression, and foreboding the most fearful con.\nsequences?

We do not mean to nsaert that\nthere is no such thing as natural grief or fel\nlow feeling; but tbe scene for the display of\nsuch affections is not a sick chamber.

I\nbethought me, thereupon, what would\nbe thought of a son of nature, a Chcro\nkec, for instance,who should witness\nthe process of \u00bbnuiT taking, and then go\namong the polished, the civilized,\nand cleanly circles of our land, and see\nthem put that vile, that poisonous,\nand, thus manufactured, that dirty\npowder, into the very fountain and\ntest of scent and smell. I verily be\nlieve that such a man would think such\nmen but little short of fools. lean a\ngree with chewing, for it seems na\ntural; the mouth having been made to\nmasticate articles, of food; and those\nwho will chew what was not exactly\nmade for chewing, why let them \u2014\nthey have the worst of it.

The very fine ap\npearance of the orchards on his farm,\nand the unusual size of the fruit, led to\nthe inquiry of the means by which this\nwas effected. Mr. Perley attributes it\nprincipally to his mode of pfuning the\ntrees. Phis he does every year; and\ntakes off a much larger proportion of\nthe branches than is usually done. By\npermitting the sun and air to have free\naccess to every branch of the tree, the\nfruit will be richer, larger, fairer, and\nmore abundant This theory derives\nsupport from the fact, that the fruit on\nthe southern side of a free is generally\nmuch superior to that on the northern.\nAnother effect of annual pruning is to\nproduce annual bearing \u2022 and this Mr.\n1 erley states to have been the case with\nhis trees, and those in the vicinity that\nhave been treated in a similar manner.\nSeveral acres of cold, wet meadow\nland on this farm have been reclaimed,\nand rendered productive of the best up\nland hay, by ditching and turning the\nwater from it, and then using the plough\nand harrow, without any manure what\never.\nMr. Perley has made some interest\ni. g experiments upon manure; and stales\nthat he finds much advantage in convey\ning the wine of his cattle upon compost\nheaps of earth and marsh mud. This is\na practice generally neglected by our\nfarmers. It is believed that, by proper\nattention, nearly as much valuable ma\nnuie can be made from the urine as\nfrom the dung of the cattle.\nThe firm of Capt. Paul Kent, situate\non Kent\u2019s Island, (so called) in Newbu\nry, contains about 250 acres. Capt.\nKent lias paid considerable attention to\nthe cultivation of root crops, and is mak\ning some interesting experiments to as\ncertain their comparative value. Of\nthose that he has tried he prefers the\ncommon blood beet and the mangel\nwurtzel, [scarcity beet] but which of\nthe two be has not fully determined.\nOn the comparative value of root crops\nand Indian corn as food for swine, Capt.\nKent lias made some experiments, and\nbelieves that corn is much to be prefer\nred in fattening swine.\nThe lands of Mr. Tristram and Hen\nry Mittle, ofAewbury, were visited by\nthe Committee with much satisfaction.\nTheir field of mangel wurtzel is the fin\nest we have ever seen; and we doubt\nnot that the produce will be at least one\nthousand bushels to tbe acre\u2014equal in\nvalue to ten tons of the best of En\nglish hay.\u2014Their experiments on In\ndian corn haye heretofore been very\nsuccessful, as the premiums of this and\nthe State Society will abundantly testi\nfy. In Ihe present year, we are of the\nopinion that their field is planted quite\ntoo thick\u2014that it contains twice as ma\nny stalks as will be found profitable. It\nis planted in rows, and has several stalks\nto every square foot of land. It seems\nto be their opinion that the best mode of\nplanting corn is in hills, from three to\nfour feet apart, and with from four to\nsix stalks in a hill. Care should be tak\nen in the selection of the seed ; \u2014this\nshould be done in the field, from the fair\nest and earliest stalks; \u2014and where two\nwell ripened earsare found on one stalk,\nthey are always to be preferred as being\nmore productive. It is important that\nthe ears earliest ripe be selected,\nfor their produce will ripen earlier in\nthe succeeding year ; and hence yield a\nsafeguard against early frosts, the most\ndangerous enemy to this most valuable\nof crops. Without good seed it is vain\nto expect large products; and the little\nattention necessary to produce the best\nseed will be abundantly rewarded in the\nquality and quantify of the harvest.\nTheir field of English turnips exceeded\nany thing of the kind witnessed else\nwhere. We were informed that they\nhid raised of this crop more than six\nhundred bushels to the acre, after a crop\nof grass had been taken from the land,\nin this way may the farmer easily reme\ndy the evil consequences of a short crop\nof hay ; \u2014a few acres well cultivated\nwith turnips will fully supply all the de\nficiencies that ordinarily occur.\u2014Their\nturnij* were planted in rows about two\nfeet apart, and so thinned that the\nplants were not permitted to grow\nwithin ten or twelve inches of each oth\ner. They hoe them several times, and\ntake care that the ground is kept loose\nabout them, and free from weeds.\nThe farm of Mr. William Thurlow,\nsituate in W. Newbury, contains about\n150 acres. It is distinguished for hav\ning the largest and most productive ap\nple orchard in the county. There are\nupon it 2500 grafted trees in a beating\ncondition. Jn some seasons they have\nyielded more than 1000 barrels of sound\nand fair winter apples, worth at least\n1200 dollars. Mr. Thurlow suffers\nsheep only to teed in his orchard grounds.\nIhe limbs of his trees being low, he\ndoes not permit cattle of any descrip\ntion to go among them. He never\nploughs the land about the trees, or ap\nplies any manure to them. He prunes\nthem more or less annually. Their\nflourishing condition must be attributed\nto the peculiar adaption of the soil to\ntheir growlh, and its superior natural\nstrength and fertility. Most of Nr.\n1 hurlow\u2019s trees produce the common\nRoxbury russet apple. This is a valu\nable fruit, and pretty sure to bear ; lut\nlately other species have come into use\nmuch more valuable. Our farmers gen\nerally appear not sufficiently attentive,\nin grafting their trees, to obtain the best\nkinds ci fruit. Regard, also, should be\nhad to the character of the tree fram\nwhich the scions are takenthat it be\nthrifty, productive, and constant in bear\ning; and that it be of a kind of fruit\nthat is not on the decline, or, in the fir\nmer\u2019s phrase, nearly run out. Natural\nfruits, of trees growing from the seeds,\nare occasionally found of excellent qual\nities, either for cider or eating. These\nshould be preferred in grafting.\n[To be continued.]\nThe two Farmers.\u2014 Two farmers who\nwere neighbours had their crops of ear\nly peas killed by the frost.\u2014One oftbem\ncame to condole with the other on their\nmisfortune\u2014\u201cAh!\u201d .cried he, \u201c how in\nfortnnate we have been, neighbour!

Even detraction has\nbeen silent at his tomb ; and the more\ngenerous of his enemies have fallen into\nIhe rank of his mourners. But he set\nlike the sun in his glory; and his orb\nwas greatest and brightest at the last;\nfor his memory is now consecrated no\nless by freedom than genius. He prob\nably fell a mariyr to his zeal against ty\nrants. He attached himself to the cause\nof Greece, and dying clung to it with a\nconvulsive grasp, and had thus gained\na niche in her history; for whatever\nshe claims as hers, is immortal even in\ndecay, as the marble sculptures on the\ncolumns of her fallen temples.\u201d\n\u2666 Shelly and Keats.\n[From Smellie\u2019s \u201c Philosophy of Natural\nHistory.\u201d]\nTHE CAME LEON.\nTo the Cameleon has been attributed\nthe singular faculty of changing the col\nour of their skin, according to the col\nour of the substance on which they are\nplaced, and of subsisting upon air. This\nbelief has arisen from the extraordinary\ns ; ze of their lungs, which they are capa\nble of distending with air to such an e\nnormous extent, as to fill nearly their\nwhole body, and render their skin some\nwhat transparent.\u2014Hence they were\nsaid to feed upon air. In this state of\ndistention and semi-transparency, the\nAkin becomes easily affected by every\nchange in the circulation ; and conse\nquently a change of colour is produced\nby the varying wants and passions of the\nanimal, which influence both the quanti\nty of respiration and the tint of the\nblood.\n[WHOLE NO. 2699.\nThe Death.

These\nsounds or beats are given in pretty quick\nsuccession, are repeated at uncertain in\ntervals, and in old houses, where the\ninsects are numerous, & may be heard at\nalmost every hour of the day\u2014espec\nially if the weather be warm.\u2019 The in\nsect is of colour so nearly resembling\nthat of decayed wood, that it may for a\nconsiderable time elude the search of\nthe inquirer.

C, June 26, \"1837.\nVr. Editor: In this District, where the\nsoil is not very rich, the planter must turn\nHis attention to ma kin;- iHii,lle\nthe soil. Already has the climate been\nchanged, by the inconsiderate custom of\nclearing lands every year; for it has\nbecome- sicklier, colder, end therefore\nless congenial to the culture of cotton. The\nsoil is light and easily, worked. And why\nshould we not avail ourselves of these ad\nvantages? .Not one planter or farmer in ten,\nthinks of manuring at all. While one will\nbe deriving fine .crops from manuring, his\nnext-door neighbor will not deign to inquire\ninto the cause. Even those who turn their\nattention to manures do not understand the\nplainest chemical elements by which they\nare to \"be regulated in its production Be\ncause it may be. beneficial to manure with\ncotton seed On top, a planter will use cow\npen and stable manure in the same way,\nas if the sun would not extract much of the\nstrength of the manure, before it could be\ncovered with the plough. Cotton seed can\nbe used on top; because, Tiefore it ferments,\nand before the sun can extract its alimentary\nproperties, it is covered in the working of\ncorn. I only mention this to show, that our\nplanters, by not thinking for themselves, are\nfrequently inconsistent. There is my neigh\nbor, Squire Suooks, who, the .moment his\nmanure arrives in the field, covers it with\ndirt, and yet he, manures his corn with it,\non lop.\nThe best planters up here adopt this plan\nof making ma nure.\nI. lne stables are lined with oak leaves,\nrotten wood, (oak best) pine trash, heaped\nin the woods for at least six months before\nused, all kinds of trash, gum pond mud, and\nlomeumes Cray, wen broken up. i nis is\ntaken out of the stables every two months, if\npossible, during a rain, heaped and covered\nwith clay or sand; if not during a rain, pour\nupon the heap, before covering it, a suffi\ncient-quantify of water to assist in fermenta\ntion. Even while the mass is in the stable,\na little water, occasionally sprinkled, with\nthe use of the grubbing-hoe at least once a\nweek, will' have a good effect. By grubbing\nwith the hoe, the animal is effectually com\nbined with the vegetable manure, and lumps\nof clay or rotten wood, are pulverized\n2. The poultry houses and yards are\ncleaned once a month, and the yield there\nfVom, thrown into the stable.\n3. All the Pride pf India berries are raked,\nand thrown into the stable.\n4. There is a. pen, six feet square, and\naix feet deep,\" below the surface, of the earth,\nfilled with leaves, and covered, into which\nthe cook and washer throw their slops and\nsuds. This is emptied at the proper time,\nheaped, and covered with trash, &,c.\n5. Hog-pens\" are ' made, six feet square,\nand six feet below the surface of the earth,\nfilled with leaves, and protected from the\nrain. The floor is made of rails, through\nthe intervals of which, the animal matter\nof the hogs is dropped. On the floor is a\nCovering of pine-trash, for beds, which the\nsharp feet of the hogs will, in a short time,\ncut into fine pieces. The hogs are either\npenned here the whole year, or sleep in them\nevery -night, or, at all events, are put up at\n'\" least one month\" to fatten', for bacon. , Ma\nnure thus made is equal to \"cotton-seed.\"\n6. Each negro is allowed Jo keep one or\ntwo hogs, on condition that they are penned,\nas above stated.\" Hogs fatten pest on wood\nen floors; and though : raw cotton-seed will\nkill them, they fatten on it when boiled with\nthe offals of the garden ana fields. xney\ndo not like cold or rain, and, : in the end, it\nwould be decidedly cheaper to pen them all\nthe year, except when they are allowed to\nrun the pea, potato, and slip fields. In the\nway I haVe described, they will make more\nmanure than the cotton seed \"they eat. Be\nsides, there is nothing safer than to have our\nhogs always in sight. - B'\n7. Cattle pens. The manure made in\nthe3e pens is. always indifferent, unless they\nbe covered. In this particular, our planters\nup here, labor under a great mistake. Their\nplan is this: Leaves and trash, thrown in\nto a pen, are trampled on by cattle, exposed\nto the weather, and, by the time the mass is\nheaped for fermentation, the best part of its\nmanuring qualities has evaporated. , On the\nother hand, when in stalls, the leaves are not\nonly trampled, but they absorb the animal\nmatter, and retain it until the manure is used1.\nA cow, when stalled, will make four times\nthe manure of a horse, in a year. Its dung\nis more susceptible of -combination with ve\ngetable matter; and, for the same reason, it\nis rendered quickly inert, by the action of\nthe sun. I have tried the difference between\ndried and fresh cow-dung, under corn. The\nformer had no effect; while Jhe latter forced\nthe corn very much. Cow pens should be\ncovered, and the cattle turned in every night.\nHowever, after all, the most profitable plan\nis to stable feed milch cows and oxen; in this\ndistrict, where we are compelled to feed cat\ntle, one half of the year, they should be fed\nwith boiled cotton-seed. That cotton-seed,\nfor corn, is superior to any manure we use,\ncannot W doubted; but, at the same time;\nwhen the improvement of cattle is consider\ned, the increase of their milk and butter, their\nprotection from theives, and the undoubted\nfact, that they can be made to produce, in\nsix months, four times more efficient manure\nthan the cotton seed they consume, I do not\nhesitate to contend, that, the better policy\nwould be, to stable-feed them on boiled cot\nton seed, for six months in the year, or during\nthe winter season. Any cow can be taught\nto eat cotton seed, by adding a little salt.\nA stall filled with leaves ctsn be emptied\nevery two months. The cow drops more\nthan the horse, and it tramples more effectu\nally it3 hoofs being sharp and wide. Ano\nther consideration is this: with cow pen ma\nnure thus mnde, land is enriched ever' time\nit is planted, and in this respect it is more\nvaluable than cotton seed. In short, to use\ncow pen manure, raked from an uncovered\npen, except lor the undecomposed vegetable\nmatter, in it, is always a useless task. In\nnine cases out of ten, it will fire the corn,\neven in a moderately wet senson. On the\ncontrary, stable manure never will; nor does\nany well fermented manure ever fire the\nplant. A gentleman in my parts has advan\nced one step towards this improvement.\nWhen the mass, in his unroofed pen, has\nbeen sulhciently trampled, h i -,;u.\nclay, and on this places another layer of\nleaves, ana so on, alternating', unui ne nas\nmade the ouantitv of manure he reouires.\nBut even this gentleman is engaged in build\ning a stable for his cows. He says, by experi\nment, 3 bushels of cotton seed per week, wiU\nfatten a cow, and 2 1-2 bushels, with shuck?,\nare enough. 50 bushels of seed, from two\nbale3 of short cotton, would enable him to\nstall-feed his cattle during the winter the\nseason when manure is made, and when cat\ntle suffer most for range. So that, after de\nducting seed for planting from everv 50\nbushels of cotton seed, he caculates to stall\nfeed one cow.

D.\nWashing Trees. The following may\nprove a useful hint to those who arc anxious\nthat their trees should possess a beautiful ap\npearance. The llostou Cultivator recom\nmends ley from wood ashes or from potash,\nas the best wash for trees. It should not be\napplied until May or June, when it .will kill\nthe moss and all the iusects that adhere to the\nbark. There is a small insect resembling a\nlouse to be found on most young trees. - 'I hey\nnever appear to move excepting in the month\nof June, and then they ar e not great travel\nlers. The ley above named, if put on in\nJune, effectually clears the tree of this insect.\nTrue Philosophy: The Farmer. Two\nFarmers, who were neighbors, had their crops\nof early peas killed bv die frost. One of them\ncame to condole with the other on their mis-\nJbitune. \"Ah!\" cried he, 'how unfortunate\nwe have been neighbor! you seem to have\ndone nothing. But bless me! you seem to\nhave a fine heallhy crop coming up just now:\nwhat are these?\" \"1 hese,\" said the other;\n\"why, these are what I sowed immediately af\nter my loss.\" \"What coming up already?\"\ncried the fietter. \"Yes; while you were fret\nting I was working.\" \"What and don't you\nfret when you have a loss?\" \"Yes, but I al\nways put it ofTuntil I have repaired the mis\nchief.\" \"Lord! why then you've no need to\nfret at all.\" \"True,\" replied the industrious\ngardtier, \"and that's the very reason; in truth\nit is very pleasant to have no longer reason to\nthink of misfortunes; and it is astonishing how\nmany might be repaired by a little alacrity and\nenergy.\" '. .\nOTEIj.

Reg.\nFeeding Horses eith Grain.-The pro\nper qtmantitV ol'ie reslective kind, is reg\nulated by weight, for in this proportion\nare the different kinds considered utirt\ntions. As for example, we give to a horse\nper day, half a bushel of oais, the weight\nof which is seventeen pounds, and if we\nwish to change to other train, as barwe.,.\nrye, or Indian corn, the same weight will\nsuffice; andi as these trains are nutch hea\nvier thtan oats a proportionate less (1ta .i.\nty by measure wil sultlice. Another rule\ndeemed important is this. that whenever\nheavier grain is substituted for oats. a\nquantity of fine cut straw should be added\nas a substittute for the husk of aie oats.\nThis induces more perlect digestion of the\ngrain.\nOats are more beneficial to horses if\nground; and hay, if chopped fine.\nTUCK iN YoUR RUFFLE.--\"We'\nfew nails to make,\" said a hhaksmith to\nhis son as lie came home from school at\n12 o'clock.

Many of them were\nboys of from nineteen to twenty years, of\nage, some of whom wero laboring under a\nhereditary taint\u2014and perhaps iu rnanv of\nthem mental deiangemenc would never\nhave been developed, had they not drunk\nof these poisoned decoctions. One boy,\nseventeen years of age, the principal support\nof a widowed mother and a little sister, was\ninduced on the Fourth day of July, 1855,\nto drink some beer, and from beer to the\nhorrible rot-gut whisky, kept in the low\ndoggeries of our city. They all gotdrunk,\nand the boy referred to, became hopelessly\nand incurably insane, and is yet in the in\nsane asylum at Dayton. . In examining the\ncase, for the purpose of getting all the an\ntecedents with it, I learned that the grand- j\nfather of the boy died iusaue. I think the I\nprobability is altogether iu favor of the idea I\nthat insanity never would have been de\nveloped in this case, had not these poison\nous admixtures acted as a powerful exci'ant\ncause. I called at a grocery store one day,\nwhere liquor is also kept. A couple of\nIrishmen came in while I was there, and\ncalled for some whisky, and the. first drank,\nand the tears flowed freely, while he at the\nsame time caught his breath like one suffo\ncated or strangling. When he could speak,\nhe says to his companion, \u201c Och, Michael,\nbut this is warming to the stomach !\u2019\u2019\nMichael drank, and went through the\nsame contortions, with the remark,\n\u201c Wouldn't it be fuiue in a cowld frhosiy\nmorning?\u201d\nAfter they had drank, I asked the land\nlord to pour me out a little in a tumbler, ia\nwhich L dipped a slip of paper, which was\nno sooner wet than it put on a scarlet hue.\nI went to my office, got my instruments\nand examined it. I fouud it had but sev\nenteen per centum of alcoholic spirits by\nweight; when it should have had forty per\ncentum to be proof, and the difference in\nper centage made up by sulphuric acid, red\npepper, petitory, custic potassa. brucine,\nand one ol the salts of Nucis Vomicae, com\nmonly called Nux Vomica. One pint of\nsuch liquor would kill the strongest man.\nEgST \u201c Going to leave, Mary ?\u201d \u201c Yes,\nmum ; I find I am very discontented.\u201d \u2014\n\u201c If there is anything I can do to make you\nmore comfortable, let me know.\u201d \u201c No,\nmum, it's impossible.

One of them,\nPenryn, nas an existence of many centuries,\nbeing recorded as a thriving market town in\n125S. The other, Falmouth, had no exis\ntence previous to the seventeenth century,\nall bough now an important seaport, and ex\nceeding its older neighbor in population and\nbusiness. Rotb towns are situated on the\nsame inlet or arm of the sea, Penryn being\nat its extreme bead. As might be expect\ned, there has existed a stroDg jealousy be\ntweeu the towns, which was not decreased\nby tleir ill-assorted uuion into one Parlia\nmentary borough, whilst still retaining their\nseparate corporate existence. Penryn con\nsidered its younger neighbor as an upstart,\nwhile Falmouth retorts by sneering at the\nolder borough, as old-fashioned, and fossili\nzed. Desperata fights and hitter personal\nquarrels have been thus occasioned.\nAbout fifteop years ago, a j\u2019ouog sailor,\nnamed Johns, a native of Penryn, belonged\nto a coasting vessel sailing between that\nport and London. He was the accepted\nsuitor of Miss Cook, a youDg girl of about\nhis own circumstances, but whose personal\nattractions gained the attention of more\nthan one man of better station. She was\nsomething of a coquette, and flirted in the\nabsence of her lover with some of her other\nadmirers.\nAmong these was a dashing young fellow, ;\na professed \u201clady killer,\u201d from Falmouth, 1\nwho had once had a quarrel with young !\nJohus, on account of local prejudice, and I\nwhose attentions to Miss Cook ware at first\nprompted by a spirit of malice to his adver\nsary. He took her to places of amusement,\nrode or walked with her on Sundays, and\nendeavored to make his attentions to her as\npublic as possibl;.\nRumors of this had reached Johns, on\nsome of his trips homo, but, as he never\n\u25a0aunt f hunt UI_\nO-;-r\u2014ksj\nwitti us little attention as possible. Once,\nhowever, Lis vessel arrived in port on a\nSunday evening, and the lovor hastily don\nned his best suit, and rushed off to see his\nlady-love. She was not at home, having\ngone to church. Impatiently ho hurried\noff to the church, and near its gate met his\napparently faithless sweetheart walking arm\nin-arm with his detested Falmouth adversa\nry. W iibout waiting to meet them, ho\ntutned and went on board his ship.\nIt wu3 tho first time when the brave\nFrankiiu was forming his expedition for the\nexploration of the Northwest Passage, and\ngreat inducements in the way of bounty\nmoney, and comparatively large pay were\nheld out to the hardy and adventurous mar- ]\nit-.ers. The two towns furnished several |\nvolunteers. Pecryn sent out four hardy '\nfellows. One of these wa3 young Johns.\u2014\nStung with the seemiDg faithlessness of his\nbeloved, he had joined the daring party that ]\nwere to seek fame, and perhaps death, amid\nthe unknown terrors of the North Pole.\nSoon after this rash step had been taken,\nJohns learned that Mbs Cook was still ^\nfaithful to him alone. The meeting between\nthem must have been both sweet and bitter\n\u2014sweet in the knowledge of each other\u2019s\nconstancy\u2014hitter in the certainty that they\nmust, part, for it was no .v too late to retract,\nldven if it were possible to withdraw from\nthis service under government, manly hon\nor forbade a cowardly desertion of the\ntownsmen who had volunteered with him ;\nnor would he care to face the jeers of the\npeople of the rival town. Besides, there\nwas u strong hope of a speedy return, and\nthe girl was somewhat, proud, after all,' of\nhis bravery, and the honor which this dar\ning step would attach to his name.\nOn a bright May morning they were mar\nried in the old church of St. Gluvia9, and a\nmerry pea! rang from the square grey tower\nin honor of the nuptials, for Johns was a\nfavorite with very many of tho townspeople,\nind the bride was, as we said, somewhat of\ni belle of the dace. Tho honevmoon was\njf but a few days'duration, for the volun\nteers were soon ordered to j oin their ships.\nOn the 23d of May, 1845, the Erebus\nmd Terror sailed from the river Thames,\nwith 135 souls on board. On the 20th of\nJuly, in that year, the whaling ship Princo\nt>f VV'ales, spoke them at the entrance of\nLancaster Sound. That was the last time\nthe members of the expedition were seen by\ncivilized men.\nThe wives of the explorers monthly drew\nhalf the pay of their husbands. The other\nhalf accumulated in the hands of the gov\nernment, until the return of their husbands,\n>r the official notification of their deaths.\u2014\nMrs. Johns drew her pay and lived at home\nwith her parents, eagerly looking for ac\ncounts of the progress of the expedition.\u2014\nIn time she became the mother of a boy,\nmd iu her new duties she passed the time\nless heavily.\nMonths rolled on to years, but still no\ntidings came of the fated vessels. Expedi\ntion after expedition went in search of the\nmissing men, but always returned with the\nsame story of privation, danger, and want\nof suooess. With painful eagerness, the\nanxious watcher grasped the weekly London\nnewspaper, in search of news of the lost\noues, and earnestly sought the opinions of\nskilful navigators, as to tho chance of their\nsafety. Hope at last seemingly died out in\nall hearts but hers. She elung to the last\nstraw.\nThose who climbed the steep of Penden\nnis Castle, eight or nine years since, may\nhave seen on Sunday afternoons a comely\nwoman, clad in plain but neat dress, seated\ndu an embrasure of a Channel, waiting and\nwatching for the vessel that never came.\u2014\nHer little boy skipped about, picking the\ndaisies and buttercups that spangled the\nglossy slopes.\nAt length hope died out of all hearts,\ne ven hors. But still she lived on her quiet\nlife. The visits to the heights were no Ion\nger made, but friends saw that tho abseo\none lived in h\u00abr thoughts. Then eame tb<\ntidings brought by Pr. Rae, convincing\nevery one that tho sad drama oft life hac\nactually been played out on those everlast\ning ice-fields. Government, which had con\ntiuued to pay the bereaved wives, was nov\ncompelled to officially announce the explo\nrers as dead. The half-pay which had ae\ncumulated in its coffers, was now paid ovoi\nto the representatives of the deceased, and\nfuture pay was stopped. To Mrs. Johns\nthe sum paid over amounted to about \u00a310(\nj sterling.\nNow, at last, the widow\u2019s words were pul\non, and the fatherless lad was dressed it\nmourning. When we last heard of them \u2014\nabout a year since\u2014they were still living\nin their native town, pursuing theold course\nof life. The widow eked out her little fund\nby sewing, and remained still constant to\nher first love.\nWhether the husband, who had seen but\na few days of wedded life, and who had\nnever seen or heard of his son, was one ol\nthe twenty-four who had died previous to\nApril 2o\u2018.h, 1848, or had participated in\nthat terrible march to death, in search of\nthe Great Fish River, we Cannot now say.\nTire receptiou of the full details of the news\nbrought by the Fox, may throw some light\non that matter. Of this we are confident,\nthat Johns did his duty to the last, and died\nas a brave man should die. There are\nthose here who know him well, and pay\nthis last tribute to the memory of an old\nfriend.\nSNOBBISH HIGH LIFE.\nTho country is running wild. Extrava\ngance, folly and fraud am the grgat pre\nvailing vices of the times\u2014the grand ehar\nac'.eristics of the age. It is manifested\nmore or less in our cities, and its influence\nis seen in the debasement of men and wo\nmen and the complete ruin of children.\u2014\nEvery successful speculator or fortunate\noperator must imitate, and if possible excel,\nhis lucky neighbor, the banker, or the mo\nnflv.molrinof rvwnnnw \u2022 ,1 4-r. .4 ~ i - a 1. ..\n- n C3 ~-7 -*\nmarble and saiin, the rosewood and silver,\nare all introduced without regard to ex\npense, extravagant carriages arc kept, with\nhorses to match, and parties are given where\nBrussels and Wilton outvie in th?ir color\nthe silks and the wine which make up the\nchief part of the entertainment.

The women\nflaunt about in lace or laziness, or recline\nupon solt cushions in carriages, neither\nknowing or caring whether the money that\nkeeps them up he stolen or honestly gain\ned. They are happy in the mere fiict that\nthey can dash as much as the richest of\ntheir neighbors.\nFor an American of fortune\u2014real, solid\nfortune\u2014to dash into all this extravagance,\nis folly ; but that man is guilty of down\nright wickedness, who, upon a little money,\ngoes to vast and foolish expense ; for he\nmust rob somebody to carry out his plau.s ;\nor if he has enough to warrant it, his chil\ndren, when his fortune is divided among\nthem, will have all the silly and extrava\ngant notions of (heir father, without his\nmoney to give them reality. Out of all\nthis miserable life, there springs evils worse\nlhan bankruptcy. The sins of the father\nire visited upon the children unto the third\ngeneration. Of what use to society are the\nchildren of such people? Sons who are\neducated to believe all this splendor consti\ntutes the best of life, and that fast horses\nind champagne are emblematic of high life.\nDaughters brought up by silly, ridiculous\nmothers, who glories in her curtains and\nher carpets, her carriage and her parties,\nind the fashionable training of her cliil\ndren.\nNice creatures, these, for a life-battle in\ni world where energy and industry and en\ndurance are worth to them more than all\nthe airs, graces and style that they learned\nin the paternal drawing room, or'Trom for\neign masters. Out of this struggle, to ex\ncel in this sort of life, thero springs, too,\nfraud and chicanery, and all manner of\ncrime, for in the contest, gold is the end\nind aim of all\u2014the means are not ie\"ard\nill. liie sensible part ot the community\nlaugh at this folly, and laugh loudly, too,\nat coarse vulgarity parading itself in gay\nequipages, and moving about with all the\nrirs and affectations of snobbish high life\npeople elevated above their fellows bv a\nstock operation, or a rise in town lots, and\nrejoicing thereafter in flashy and in gaudy\nhouses.\nIf they made fools of themselves alone,\nit would all be proper enough. But the\neffect upon their families, and upon socie\nty, is most to be dreaded.\nIn a country whore the law divides\namong a man\u2019s heirs all his estates after\ndeath, unless disposed of by will, and where\nthe chances are that the property will net\nremain in the family beyond the second\ngeneration, it is utter folly to build palaces\nto live in\u2014far better would it be to expend\nthe same money in building schools, or\nfounding asylums, the benefit of which the\nrich man\u2019s heirs may need.

I had got it to try an ex\nperiment on some poor land, that lay off a\ncouple of miles from my bouse. I suppose\nka man ought to apologise for owning land so\nfar from home, for it is ccrtaiuly very bad\nhusbandry. The expense of cultivating it\nis nearly double that of a home lot, and\nmanuring with stable dung at that distance\nis out of the question. The fact is, the land\nbelongs to Mrs. Bunker, and, as it came\nfrom her father, she never felt like selling\nit. It has been used for pasture ever since\ni can remeniDcr. Dor the last ten years .I\nLave not been very particular about pastur\ning it, for there was not much grass there\nto be eaten. It was miserable old plain\nland, and had once been a light sandy loam,\nbefore the loam was carried off in orop3. It\nbore five-fingers and moss pretty well, was\nfair for pennyroyal, and famous for mullens\nand sweet fern. The sheep had worn little\npaths around among these brush, and if\nsheep have any virtue to restore exhausted\nland, that field never found it out. I sup\npose all the vegetable matter that grew upon\nan acre, if it could have been gathered,\nwould not have weighed two hundred pounds.\nIt used to be said of it, that it wor too poor\nto bear worms and insects, so that skunks\nhad to starve or emigrate.\nWe have a great deal of such land in all\nthe old States, thoroughly worn out, and\nnot paying the interest on three dollars an\naere, to their present owners. They are gen\nerally farmers in moderate circumstances,\nand have no spare capital to give sueli\nland a start, and it lios idle and worthless.\nI thought it was worth trying to give this\nout lot a chance to do a little better by itself\nand its owner. My plan was to turn in\ngreen crop3, a process in husbandry thit no\none practiocs in this neighborhood, I had\nread of it in my Agriculturist, and thought\nit was just the iLing for lots too far off from\nthe barn to be manured from the stable._\nThe trouble was to get the green crop to\nturn under.\nI thought the guano would probably start\nrye, and with this I could make a beginning.\nI plowed up five acres two years ago in Oc\ntober, and put on five bags of guano, or a\nbout one hundred and fifty pounds to the\nacre. The rye came up well, and looked a\nremarkably dark green, and by the time\nsnow fell, the ground was well ooverad with\na thick mat of rye. That rye made a good\ndeal of talk, and even on Sunday it used to\nbe discussed between meetings, when folks\nought to have been thinking on other mat\nters. It passed the Wintai well, got a good\nstart in the Spring, and by the middle of\n!\\T:lW flan iinorle knrrin f rt nnnonM T*. \u2014 I_-1\n- -L'L\nthick, and was thought to be one of the best i\nlooking pieces of rye in town. It went\nagaiust the grain amazingly to turn it under,\nfor according to the look, I should have had\nfifteen bushels to the acre.\nAbout the middle of June, John and I\nwent into it, with two teams, to plow it un\nder; for I had made my plan, and was not\nto be turned aside by the talk of my neigh\nbors. Tucker and Jones said it was a great\nshame to spoil such a field of grain, aod ev\nen Mr. Spooner remarked, that making ma\nnure of bread stuff, did not seem to bo very\ngood economy. Now, you see, I did not\ncare so much what George Washington Tuck\ner and Benjamin Franklin Jones said, but I\ndid not like to bs undervalued by the minis\nter. So said I to Mr. Spooner: \u201cA thing\nalways looks homely until it is finished; and\nyou just wait till I get through with this\nfield, before you make up your mind.\u201d\nThe rye was plowed under, and the ground\nturned up^bont two inches deeper than ev\ner before. In about a fortnight I sowed\nbuckwheat, harrowing it in with about the\nsame quantity of guano, that I bad used in\nthe rye. The buckwheat came up and grew\nmore rankly than anything I ever saw be\nfore. All the neighbors were astonished\nat the monstrous growth, and most astonish\ned when I brought out the teams, the last\nof August, to turn it under. They said Tim\nBunker must be crazy to make manure of the\nheaviest crop of buckwheat in town. But\nthe buckwheat went under notwithstanding.\nThe last of September I sowed with rye\nagain, and as I had put two green crops un\nder tho sod, I thought the land had got start\nenough to take care of itself. I sowed with\nthe rye, clover and hord-grass seed, calcu\nlating that these would take the ground\nwhen the rye came off. Last July I har\nvested from that five acre field, one hundred\nand twenty-five bushels of rye worth as ma\nny dollars. They have got to making pa\nper out of the straw, so that I got ten dollars\na tun for that or about seventy-fivo dollars.\nNow, every man who is used to ciphering\ncan tell whether the operation paid or not.\nThe crop, I consider worth two buudred dol\nlars, to say nothing of the Boo catch of gras#\nwhich now promises at )ea.,t a tun and a\nhalf of hay to tLe acre. The cost of the ma\nnure was about forty-five dollars. The la\nbor of plowing, sowing, harvesting, and the\ngrass seed would, perhaps, swell the cost of\nthe improvement to one hundred and fi ty\ndollars. 1 his leaves a handsome sum on the\nright side of the balance sheet, aud the laud\nin a much better condition. The old plain\nwould have been well sold at five dollars an\nacre, for it did not pay the interest on half\nthat sura. I should not want to soil now at\nten dollars an acre. TLe experiment Las\nworked much better than I thought it would.\nNow, I think we have here a bint as to\nthe economical way cf giving land a start.\nIf it lie# near the barn, wLere manure can\nbe carted cheaply, tho stable manure is tbo\nbest renovator. If it lies at a distance it\ncan be done with Peruvian No. 1, and green\ncrops, and it is much better to do it with\nthis, than to have it lie idle.

Michael kept tavern a number of\nyears\u2014married and raised four children._\nHe accumulated an immense estate, which\nhe reserved so tenaciously that he never af\nforded a dollar for the education of his\nchildren. He was never known to lay out\none dollar in cash for any article he need\ned; he would either do without it, or find\nsome person who would barter with him for\nsomething which he could not conveniently\nsell for money. Ho farmed largely and\nkept a large distillery, which lie supplied\nentirely with his own erain. He kent. .i\nteam for the conveyance of his whiskey to\nBaltimore, where, when he could not sell\nfor money to suit him, he bartered for ne\ncessaries for his family and tavern. In this\nway he amassed an cstato worth $100,000.\nSuch wa3 his attachment to money that he\nwas never known to credit a single dollar\nto any man. Upon tho best mortgage as\nsecurity that could be given he would not\nlend a cent. He never vested a dollar in\n\u25a0 public funds, neither would he keep the\nnotes of any bank longer than he could get\nthem changed. He deposited his specie in\na large iron chest, ui\\til ic would hold no\nmore. He then provided a strong iron\nhooped barrel, which he also tilled, After\nhi; death his strong boxes yielded \u00a7250,000\nin gold and silver.\nThe cause of his death was as remarka\nble a3 the course of his life. A gentleman\nfrom Virginia offered him $12 a bushel for\n110 bushels of eloverseei, but ho would\nnot do it for less than jj 13, and they did\nnot agree. The soed was afterwards sent\nto Philadelphia, where it was sold for $7\nper bushel, and brought in the whole $550\nless than the Virginian had offered for it.\nOn receiving an account of his sale, he\nwalked through his farm, went to his dis\ntillery, and gave directions to his people;\nhe then went to his wagon house and hung\nhimself.\nCROCKETT OUTDONE.\n\u201c Turkeys used to be very plenty here in\nIndiana,\u201d said the old Major.* \u201c i\u2019ve seen\n\u2019em so thick you couldn\u2019t hardly get about\nfor \u2019em. They kept the ground scratched\nup so meller that a feller would sink knee\ndeep into it. You needu\u2019t to laugh, for I\ncan prove every word of it. To let you\nknow how thick they were, i\u2019ll just tell you\nwhat l did once. I started out one night\nto kill some turkeys, but before I got very\nfar I found that I had but one bullet with\nme, except the one in my gun. Thinks I\nmis is a Daa jod, Dut i ll uo the best i can\nwith \u2019em. So I goes on, and I see3 a great\nmany fine looking turkeys, but they warn\u2019t\nfixed to suit me. At last I sees about fifty\nsittin\u2019 all along side by side on one straight\nlimb, so I slips along under \u2019em and scores\naway, and what do you think ?\u201d\n\u201c Expect you killed two at one shot,\u201d\nsaid several of the listeners.\n\u201c No sir, I didn\u2019t shoot at \u2019em. I split\nthe limb that they were sittin\u2019 on, it open\ned, their legs slipped through, it slapped to\ngether again, and I had \u2019em all trapped. I\nthen loaded my gun with ibe other bullet,\nblazed away, and shot the limb olf clo38 to\nto the. tree. Down they came a flutterin\u2019\nand a floppin\u2019, and I shouldered the limb\nand carried \u2019em all home.\u201d\nA Good Test.\u2014The rule of the road is\na very good test of the difference between a\ngentleman and a blaokguard. Whenever\nwo meet a man, whether in a carriage or\nwith ox-team, who gives us more than half\nthe road, we respect him as a gentlemau.\u2014\nBut whenever we meet a young man who\ndrives rapidly oo, without giving an inch\nof the road, we pity him a? a poor misera\nble fellow. The same test may be applied\nto pedestrians on the paveoiants, whore\nladies are frequently and rudely jostled by\nwell dressed blackguards.\nMrs. Partington says that nothing despi\nses her so much, as .to see people \"'who pro\nfess to expeot salvation, to go to church\nwithout their purses,, when a recollection is\nto be taken.\nAn Answer.\u2014The Rev. Dr. Mason, of\nNew York, passing up Broadway, stopped\nto read a theatrioal placard, which attraoted\nhis attention. Cooper, the tragedian, com -\ning along, said to him:\n\u201c Good morning, sir\u2014do ministers of the\ngospel read such things ?\u201d\n1 Why not, sir,\u2019 said the Doctor; 'minis\nters of the gospel have a right to know wbat\nthe devil is about, as well as other folk.\u2019\n- IE9K9S6EE9\nSelections for Scrap Book*\nNo. 62.\nTrue Philosophy\u2014The two Punier*\nTaro farmers, who were neighbors, had\ntheir crops of early peas killed by host.\u2014\nOoe of them came to condole with the other\non their misfortune. \u00abAh,\" cried hef\n\u201c h\u00b0w unfortunate we have been, neighbor t\nl have done nothing but fret ever sinoe.\u00ab*\nBut bless me 1 you seem to hare a Sue\nhealthy crop coming up juat now : what are\nthese 1\u201d\n\u201c These,\u201d said the other, \u201c why these are\nwhat I sowed immediately ufter my loss.\"\n\u201c What, coming up already ?\u201d cried the\nfretter. \u201c Yes; while you were fretting I\nwas working.\u201d \u201cWbat, and don\u2019t you\nfret when you have a loss T\u201d\n\u201c Yes, but I always put it off until I hare\nrepaired the mischief.\"\n\u201c Why, then, you\u2019re no need to fret at\nall.\u2019 \u201c True,\u201d replied the industrious gar\ndener, \u201c and that is tbs rory reason; in\ntruth, it is very pleasant to have no longer\nreason to think of misfortunes; and it Ik\nastonishing how many might be repaired by\na little alacrity and energy.\u201d\nResisting Conscienca\nTo go on in a course of defection, when\nan enlightened conscience is stirring and\nlooking you ia the face, and crying within\nyou that you are going in an evil way, is a\nstep to the sin against the Holy Ghost.\u2014\nWhen the truth is come to your hand, hold\nit fast; go not again to make a searoh and\nnew inquiry for truth; it is easy to east\nyour light into prison, and detain God'a\ntruth in nnrighteouscess, but that prisoner\nwill break ward, to your incomparable tor\nture.\u2014R uthei ford.\nA Good and a Bad Workman.\nIf one workman should tell you that\n\u201cyour house must be pulled down, that the\nbeams are all rotteu, and new materials\nmust be prepared;\u201d and another should\nsay, \u201c ^io, the house will stand firm enough\nwith a littlo repair; such a beam is good,\nsuch a spar may continue, and a trifling\ncost will serve the turn,\u201d you would proba?\nbly listen to him who is for putting you to\nthe least trouble.\nA \u2014 I_i l <\u2022 \u2022. i s < \u2022 \u2022 . \u2014.\nuvuwv uuu iuuuiui uiiuister or Uurisv\ncomes and tells sinners from the Scriptures,\nthat man is, by nature, in a dangerous con\ndition ; that his house ia tumbling about hi*\nears; that his natural state is oorrupt and\nrotten; that nothing of the original frame\nwill serve; that old things must be dona\naway, and all things become new.\nNext, in stops auother who tells tho sin\nner that he is neither so weak nor so wiok\ned as tho other represents him; that a lit\ntle patching and whitewashing will set all\nto rights, without taking any part of tha\nbuilding down.\n\u201c If thou wilt,\u201d says he, \u201c thou mayest\nrepent, believe, be good, and endure to tha\nend; or, at least, by exerting thy natural\nabilities, thou wilt oblige God to land a\nhelping hand to thy endeavors, and super\nadd what thou hast not.\u201d This is the work\nman that will please proud men best. \u2014 C?iw\u00ab\nnail.\nDegrees of Guilt\nWhen the balance shall ba struck be\ntween small sins (so called), with great\nprivileges, in the one scale\u2014end orying\nsins with few responsibilities, in the other\nscale\u2014who shall say th3t Infinite Justice\nmay not sea deeper guilt in the unkind\nword, tho uncharitable suspicion, th4* sel\nfish act, and other manifestations of an un\nChristian spirit, in which Christians are toe\noften tempted to iodulgc, than in the more\nglaring departure from the law of God of\nthose who have but just begun to hoar of a\nSaviour\u2019s love, and to know anything of it*\nconstraining power.\u2014Hearts and Hands.\nThe Heart.\nThe little I have seen of tho world, and\nkoow of the history of mankind, teaches me\nto look upon tho errors of others in sorrow,\nnot in auger.
