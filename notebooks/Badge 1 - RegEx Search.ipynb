    "## 1. What are Regular Expressions and what are they useful for?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Expression:** A regular expression (or RegEx) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms to \"find\" or \"find and replace\" words in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use regular expressions for word frequency analysis (e.g. to find all mentions of the words ```woman``` or ```women```, to explore your dataset and see how particular vocabulary is used in context or to transform your dataset into a particular structure. Regular expression are a way to be a bit vague about text while being incredibly specific at the same time. The examples below will explain what we mean by that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to construct regular expressions. E.g., you can use a wildcard * or you can use a range of letters, e.g., [ae] (for a or e), [a-z] (for a to z), or numbers, e.g., [0-9] (for all single digits) etc. Regular expressions can be very powerful if used correctly. For example, to find all mentions of the words woman or women you need to use the following regular expression: wom[ae]n.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will give you a taster for using regular expressions and some examples. For a more detailed overview of Regular Expressions, you can refer to the Programming Historian lesson 'Understanding Regular Expressions' at https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/understanding-regular-expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Building a Regular Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's stick with our example and imagine we want to see all the words that refer to `women` in text. As human beings we know that this includes both the singlular `woman` and plural `women`. Computers need us to be very very specific, and so regular expressions provided us with a way to capture such small but significant differences when searching text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to arrive at a Regular Expression is to specify what we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We could say: give me all occurrences of `woman` and `women` and then add them all.\n",
    "- We could say: give me all occurrences of `wom*n` where `*` is `a` or `e`. \n",
    "- We could say: give me all occurrences of `wom[ae]n`.\n",
    "- We could say: give me all exact matches of `^wom[ae]n$`, which also means that there can be nothing before or after these characters, so words like `superwomen` and `womanly` will not be included."

A man in Florida named Myron Jones wrote us this letter. He said that when he was 16 years old, growing up without a dad in Buffalo, New York, he was allowed to stay out till midnight.  He came and went as he pleased. Spent a lot of time in bars, actually. This was the 1940s. But his sister Carol, she had different rules, and she wasn't let out of the house at all, even though she was older than Myron. This story gets to babysitting in a big, big way. And I called him to talk about it.  \n",

And I remember when she first told me about it. She said listen, guess what I did, I made up a family. I said what do you mean? I made up this family I babysit for, they're called the McCrearys.  \n",

      "@Carol Jones\tShe used to follow me. She had a friend. We called them Sam Spade and the fat man. And they would follow us. And then I'd go home, and she'd come in and say where have you been. It was-- it was really, really hard. She didn't believe anything I ever said.  \n",

      "@Ira Glass\tSo the McCrearys had a summer house.  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tYes.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tAnd did they require your services at the summer house?  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tYes, indeed. They knew that the kids would enjoy it so much more if we were there. And it was we, because both my brother and I always liked little kids a lot, you know. So my mother would accept this quite readily, you know, that they wanted the both of us out at the lake. It was wonderful. We had such a good summer. I mean, it was glorious.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWhat would you do?  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tWell, we just-- sometimes if we knew someone out there-- sometimes kids we knew would have cottages, you know kids used to get together and chip in, or their parents would have a cottage. Sometimes we'd just sleep on the beach, which was great. I'd love sleeping on the beach.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tI have to say every time you talk about the freedom you got, your voice becomes completely different. It's like you can still taste it.  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tI still remember what that was like. It offered freedom that was just so wonderful to me.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tWe really got all of this from our mother, this notion of fantasy people. Our mother had, from the time we were young kids, younger than 10, our mother had three people that she went to see. None of them existed, and we always knew they didn't exist.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tReally?  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tYeah.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWho were they?  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tOne was a lawyer. And she wouldn't say what she was doing there, but she'd drop little hints. And what we were supposed to believe was that was making arrangements to put us in an orphanage. The second person she saw was a psychiatrist, which she pronounced psycholorgist-- interesting. And she went there because he would tell her that we were driving her crazy.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tI see.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tAnd the third person was a doctor, who told her she was going to die. And we had no idea where in fact she went, but she was never gone long enough to see anyone at all.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tSo in other words, she would literally-- this wasn't just something she would say to you, well, I've been to a psychiatrist and he tells me that you're driving-- that you guys are driving me crazy. She would actually leave the house and go to her appointment.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tYeah, she'd say-- she'd say-- she'd go for the door, and when we were young, we'd say where you going, Ma, because it was so unusual for her to go out, except to work. And she'd say wouldn't you like to know? Oh, OK. Is it your doctor? As we got older, she'd say, maybe. And so that was her game.  \n",

And then Carol would give her far more information and she asked for.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tSay more of what you remember of what she would tell her.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tWell, one was that Mrs. McCreary was very intelligent, and lovely, and very kind. She was my sister's fantasy of a mother. And she was my fantasy of an older woman who might fall in love with me, and with any luck at all seduce me.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tSo wait, would you talk about it with your mom too?  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tYeah, my sister started that. I was a little uncomfortable about it. My sister said I think he's got a crush on her. And I would almost blush, uncomfortably, because I did.  \n",

      "@Myron Jones\tNo, she didn't ask questions like that. She never asked questions like that.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tSo what would she ask?  \n",

      "@Ira Glass\tAnd a kind of in-depth conversation.  \n",

      "@Ira Glass\tThat they'd be a good influence somehow.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tThey'd be a good influence and there might even be some money in it. Carol also handled-- because she wasn't getting any money from babysitting, she said that Mr. McCreary was taking all the babysitting money and putting it into stocks and bonds.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWait, wait, hold it, just back up.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tYeah, Carol knew she was going to ask, so she anticipated it. Carol said, before it could even come up, Carol said Mr. McCreary isn't going to pay me. He's going to pay all my babysitting money into stocks and bonds. My mother didn't know anything about stocks and bonds, and neither did we. But my mother knew that that's what rich people did. And it was over on the other side of town, the rich side of town.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tRight.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tMy mother didn't know anything about that neighborhood. She was the oldest of seven children, grew up in a very really poor family. My mother had one friend who was middle class, who she'd met when my father was still alive. And she influenced my mother. And so did the people that my mother cleaned for.  At the end of the summer, it was the last weekend. And that was near the real change in the McCreary time.  \n",

      "@Myron Jones\tYeah, right. And those times when there was no cottage to go to, and we'd sleep out on the beach, and we were going home, and we headed up the back stairs. We always had to go in the back way. We headed up the back stairs, and we'd go to the second floor.  And we could tell before we turned the corner that our mother was outside the door, waiting for us. And we turned, and there she was. And she looked ready to kill. She looked absolutely furious. She said well, where you too been? And I though, oh, god, she found out all about the summer cottage stuff.  And Carol said, you know where we've been, ma, at the McCrearys. And my mother said, oh, yeah. Well, you're a couple of damn liars. I just got off the phone with Mrs. McCreary. She hasn't seen you in weeks.  \n",

      "@Myron Jones\tCarol got over it immediately, and said, sorry, Ma. Nice try. We just left the McCrearys 10 minutes ago. Went in the house. She didn't say anything to us, we didn't say anything to her. And after that, we really stopped talking about the McCrearys.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tDid she often claimed that she had run into the McCrearys?  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tYes, that she'd talked to her, that she hadn't seen me. She did it so often. She believed this. It was amazing, but she never questioned these things.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tWhy do you think she didn't question it?  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tI think she wanted it to be true, probably as much as I did.  \n",

      "@Carol Jones\tYeah, I probably did. I don't think that-- well, you know, it did. I'm sure it did occur to me that I wanted a family that would please her.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tIs that because-- is that because it would make her more likely to let you out? Or was there a part of it where you also were the kind of kid where you always needed to be reassuring her anyway?  \n",
      "@Carol Jones\tOh, I had to constantly reassure her, always. I mean, it isn't something I talk easily about, but she really never liked me. That was the problem.  \n",

      "@Ira Glass\tDoes it make you sad that you can't have the kind of relationship with your mom, where now that everyone's an adult, you know, you can't come straight with all of it?  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tNo, my sister and I-- I think because of, because of going away to school when I was so young-- let me back up a little bit. When I was nine, I came home on a Saturday afternoon, and my mother said, I'm sorry you weren't here, because Father Sager, who was an Episcopal priest, was here visiting. And he found a very nice orphanage for you.  And I said, but I'm not an orphan, Ma. She said, no, I know. I told Father Sager that. But he said, really you are, because I have to work all the time, and there's no one to take care of you. And I said, well, we take care of ourselves. And she said, I need to tell Father Sager that, but he said, not really. You go there, it'll be a good place for you. You go there.  I was close to-- I was in my 30s before I understood why I went away to school when I was 10. I didn't have to. I could have not gone. I could have screwed up the test. I could have gone and gotten kicked out right away. I knew that. One of the things that our mother did with us, from the time we were very young.  I can't remember before, but I know before I went to school, my mother used to say to us, when your father died, everybody told me to put the two of you in an orphanage. I didn't, and that was the biggest mistake of my life. So when the day came, I came home, and she said, Father Sager found an orphanage for you, what I really did was say, you've been threatening me with this all my life, and now, damn it, I'm going to go.  \n",
      "@Ira Glass\tYeah.  \n",
      "@Myron Jones\tAnd it felt safer. I was scared as hell. I was one of two kids in the sixth grade. The other kid never showed up. I went to all classes alone for six weeks. And after six weeks, I went home. And I was-- it was late October, already dark in Buffalo, and around supper time. And I was walking down the street, and I loved my neighborhood. I knew everybody. I looked, and the lights were on, thinking it's warm in there. That's people-- that's Sonny Calucci's house. That's his house. They're in there. And I have a house too.  I go to school now, but I have a house too. And I'm almost there. And I walked in the door, and I started to hug my mother. And my mother put out her hand to hold me back, and said, now, let me ask you a question. When you're up there at that fancy school, do you ever think about your mother, lying here in bed, crying her eyes out every single night? You ever think about that? Nah, you never think about anybody but yourself. And I literally from that moment on have never asked my mother for anything, never looked to her for anything.  \n",

      "@Carol Jones\tOne time, when I was 35, I lashed out at her in such a way, and told her how I felt about her, and she sat in a chair in the kitchen, and she was crying. And I had never even seen her cry before. And when I finally stopped talking, she said, I did the very best I could. And I thought, oh, my god, she did. Her best was so bad. Her best was so empty. But she couldn't do any better.  I decided, and it helps me a lot-- I have a great aunt that I just adored, and her mother, my mother's mother, who was wonderful, and my great-grandmother, who I didn't know, but who adored my mother, my mother slept in bed with her, I thought I'm going to do this for the people that loved her, you know, all of the people that really loved this little girl, I'm going to do it for them.

A man in Florida named Myron Jones wrote us this letter. He said that when he was 16 years old, growing up without a dad in Buffalo, New York, he was allowed to stay out till midnight.  He came and went as he pleased. Spent a lot of time in bars, actually. This was the 1940s. But his sister Carol, she had different rules, and she wasn't let out of the house at all, even though she was older than Myron. This story gets to babysitting in a big, big way. And I called him to talk about it.  \n",

I made up this family I babysit for, they're called the McCrearys.  \n",

When I was nine, I came home on a Saturday afternoon, and my mother said, I'm sorry you weren't here, because Father Sager, who was an Episcopal priest, was here visiting. And he found a very nice orphanage for you.  And I said, but I'm not an orphan, Ma. She said, no, I know. I told Father Sager that. But he said, really you are, because I have to work all the time, and there's no one to take care of you. And I said, well, we take care of ourselves. And she said, I need to tell Father Sager that, but he said, not really. You go there, it'll be a good place for you. You go there.  I was close to-- I was in my 30s before I understood why I went away to school when I was 10. I didn't have to. I could have not gone. I could have screwed up the test. I could have gone and gotten kicked out right away. I knew that. One of the things that our mother did with us, from the time we were very young.  I can't remember before, but I know before I went to school, my mother used to say to us, when your father died, everybody told me to put the two of you in an orphanage. I didn't, and that was the biggest mistake of my life. So when the day came, I came home, and she said, Father Sager found an orphanage for you, what I really did was say, you've been threatening me with this all my life, and now, damn it, I'm going to go.  \n",

And after six weeks, I went home. And I was-- it was late October, already dark in Buffalo, and around supper time. And I was walking down the street, and I loved my neighborhood. I knew everybody. I looked, and the lights were on, thinking it's warm in there. That's people-- that's Sonny Calucci's house. That's his house. They're in there. And I have a house too.  I go to school now, but I have a house too. And I'm almost there. And I walked in the door, and I started to hug my mother. And my mother put out her hand to hold me back, and said, now, let me ask you a question. When you're up there at that fancy school, do you ever think about your mother, lying here in bed, crying her eyes out every single night? You ever think about that? Nah, you never think about anybody but yourself. And I literally from that moment on have never asked my mother for anything, never looked to her for anything.  \n",

A man in Florida named Myron Jones wrote us this letter. He said that when he was 16 years old, growing up without a dad in Buffalo, New York, he was allowed to stay out till midnight.  He came and went as he pleased. Spent a lot of time in bars, actually. This was the 1940s. But his sister Carol, she had different rules, and she wasn't let out of the house at all, even though she was older than Myron. This story gets to babysitting in a big, big way. And I called him to talk about it.  \n",

I made up this family I babysit for, they're called the McCrearys.  \n",

And he found a very nice orphanage for you.  And I said, but I'm not an orphan, Ma. She said, no, I know. I told Father Sager that. But he said, really you are, because I have to work all the time, and there's no one to take care of you. And I said, well, we take care of ourselves. And she said, I need to tell Father Sager that, but he said, not really. You go there, it'll be a good place for you. You go there.  I was close to-- I was in my 30s before I understood why I went away to school when I was 10. I didn't have to. I could have not gone. I could have screwed up the test. I could have gone and gotten kicked out right away. I knew that. One of the things that our mother did with us, from the time we were very young.  I can't remember before, but I know before I went to school, my mother used to say to us, when your father died, everybody told me to put the two of you in an orphanage. I didn't, and that was the biggest mistake of my life. So when the day came, I came home, and she said, Father Sager found an orphanage for you, what I really did was say, you've been threatening me with this all my life, and now, damn it, I'm going to go.  \n",

I looked, and the lights were on, thinking it's warm in there. That's people-- that's Sonny Calucci's house. That's his house. They're in there. And I have a house too.  I go to school now, but I have a house too. And I'm almost there. And I walked in the door, and I started to hug my mother. And my mother put out her hand to hold me back, and said, now, let me ask you a question. When you're up there at that fancy school, do you ever think about your mother, lying here in bed, crying her eyes out every single night? You ever think about that? Nah, you never think about anybody but yourself. And I literally from that moment on have never asked my mother for anything, never looked to her for anything.  \n",

So the man in the family was an FBI agent, working on a top secret project, so he could not give his phone number to anyone at all.
