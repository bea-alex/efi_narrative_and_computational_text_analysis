    "\n",
    "[Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov) is a digital repository produced by the Library of Congress which gives access to digitised copies of historical newspapers pages published in the United States from 1777-1963, the U.S. Newspaper Directory of American newspapers published between 1690-present and other resources. Online users can access the data in Chronicling America via a search interface.\n",

    "## 2. Conventional Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites whose data can be accessed using conventional search provide users with a search bar, such as the one you will be familiar with from Google. To enable conventional search, the Library of Congress (LOC), which provides access to Chronicling America, needs a **search engine** under the hood. Instead of accessing the whole World Wide Web, LOC's search engine is limited to the digitised collections it provides access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works, taking Chronicling America as an example, is that all the text in the newspaper pages is indexed, i.e. it is stored in a large **search index**.  A search index can be thought of a bit like a structured encyclopaedia. When you look for (or query) a word, it is looked up in the index which can then easily retrieve all the documents (in this case, the newspaper pages) that are relevant to the query.  In the case of Chronicling America, the images of the newspaper pages are also stored along with the digitised text.  So when you look for words, the results are displayed as highlighted text in the relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by searching for the phrase 'little alacrity and energy'. If you're trying out this search yourself, you'll see that it takes some time for the search engine to find the relevant sources that match your query. Once it's finished searching, you can see the results for this search in the screenshot below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/CA-search-example-2.png\" alt=\"Chronicling America Search Example\" width=\"700px\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata, provided in text below each image of a newspaper page, shows the page and name of the paper, the publication date and the most relevant snippet matching the search query. Each newspaper image also shows the matching words highlighted in the page which can be helpful when trying to find the relevant phrases on the page. The information on the left-hand panel shows how many matches the query returned, and which newspapers they appear in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using conventional search you can now browse through the results and dig into the data to find interesting mentions and their context. However, doing this is time-consuming and most people do not look past the first page of results returned as it requires a lot of clicking back and forth. But have a go yourself by following this direct link to our search 'little alacrity and energy':\n",

    "## 3. Application Programming Interface (API) Search\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a complicated way of describing an interface between two applications, or between a human and an application or database.  You can think of an API a bit like a waiter in a restaurant. You know how to talk to the waiter to order food or pay the bill. The waiter acts as the 'interface' between you and the restaurant, bringing you the food you've ordered while shielding you from all the complicated stuff that's going on behind the scenes such as food deliveries, stock management, cooking and cleaning dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of searching, an API provides a way to access data systematically using structured queries. A search API allows you to search existing items in a data collection or catalogue, in our case the historical newspaper collections hosted on Chronicling America. In this case, the search API is the interface to the data, and you just need to learn how to communicate with it (i.e. formulate your query using syntax the API can understand) to get the right information back, i.e. to return newspaper pages that are relevant to your search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "A search API allows you to execute a search query using a URL and get back results that match the query. In this sense, it's not that different to conventional search. You just need to learn how the search query URLs are constructed to do the search (instead of typing out your query in the search box and clicking \"Go\", which can be laborious if you have a lot of queries to run). Another useful difference is that with an API, rather than results just being displayed in your browser, you can often specify to download them immediately onto your computer in different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how it works in action."

    "### 3.2 Using the Library of Congress API to search the Chronicaling America data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Text Search\n",
    "\n",
    "All Chronicling API searches start with the following base URL (expanded with path parameters): https://www.loc.gov/collections/chronicling-america/\n",
    "\n",
    "This URL is expanded further using specific search parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. a simple search for articles containing the word \"alacrity\" is made up of the base URL https://www.loc.gov/, expanded with the path parameters \"collections/chronicling-america/\" to specify the collection and followed by the search parameters \"?ops=AND&qs=alacrity&searchType=advanced\", all combined to: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/chronicling-america/?ops=AND&qs=alacrity&searchType=advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "`collections/chronicling-america/` is an instruction about which collection to search more specifically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything after the question mark specifies the search query and parameters. In this case, we want to search the full text of the newspapers, which is done by using `searchType=advanced`, using the query string \"alacrity\" (`qs=alacrity`) and the AND operator (which searches for all words in the query anywhere in the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proximate Search\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Chronicling America's browser interface to do a search with multiple words, you are asking it to do what is also known as a proximate search. This means that the search engine searches for all the words within each page, but they don't need to appear one after the other.  You may have noticed this when inspecting the results of the conventional search earlier, as some results don't contain the exact search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a search query for the API, proximate search can be replicated using the `ops=AND` search parameter and using plus signs between multiple words.  So, the API search for the equivalent browser search for \"little alacrity and energy\" is:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/chronicling-america/?ops=AND&qs=little+alacrity+and+energy&searchType=advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on this link, a new tab should open which contains the results you looked at earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phrase Text Search\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do a search for the exact phrase by using the `ops=PHRASE` parameter, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/chronicling-america/?ops=PHRASE&qs=little+alacrity+and+energy&searchType=advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this only returns a small number of pages containing the exact phrase \"little alacrity and energy\" but not the pages which also contain all four individual words.  You can achieve the same in the browser search by going to \"Advanced Search\" and running a search with the phrase \"little alacrity and energy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But hang on, what's so special about API searches, if I can do the exact same thing in the browser? What are they useful for?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Formats and Downloading Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful thing about Search APIs is that they often allow you to download the data in a specified format directly to your computer, so that you can do further analysis with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you send a query to the Chronicling America API without specifying a file format, you will receive your results in html format, which is the default, meaning the results are displayed in a new tab in your browser.  So, nothing new there.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the API also allows you to ask for your results to be delivered in json, pdf or xml format. This way you can easily download the files to your computer or bring them into your notebook for further analysis, for instance if you want to use regular expressions to find strings in the text or perhaps perform sentiment analysis on the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**json** stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).  In our case, it's used to store all the results for a search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pdf** stands for Portable Document Format, which is a file format developed by Adobe and is widely used for sharing documents that need to maintain their visual appearance, such as reports, forms and publications (in our case the images of pages of newspapers). We don't work with the images in this class but they are available to you should you want to download them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**xml** stands for eXtensible Markup Language, which is a markup language for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML uses tags to structure data hierarchically, making it ideal for storing structured information. In this case, XML format is used to store the underlying transcribed text displayed on each newspaper page.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with the results in json and xml format. For example, if we adapt our previous query so it requests the results in json, it will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/chronicling-america/?ops=PHRASE&qs=little+alacrity+and+energy&searchType=advanced&fo=json\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `fo=json` is used to request json format and this search parameter is added after an ampersand (&) which separates multiple search parameter key/value pairs."

The code only continues to run if the API returns a result. \n",

In our previous example, we only worked with a small number of results.  Next, you'll learn how to collect and analyse data, when the query returns a lot more results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the query (`black cat`) below, we get over 58,900 results with 20 results per page, so 2,974 pages of results.  In a real browser, you would most likely only look at the first few pages of results to find  information that's relevant to you and, in some cases, refine your query to get fewer, more specific results.\n",

    "Using an API, you could collect and analyse all of the data. However, this would take quite a long time to do.  So in this case, we cap the number of results at 60 (3 pages of 20 results).  This is mainly to show how this kind of data collection works in principle without taking too long and overloading the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, APIs have constraints which allow you search them only up to X times per minute, hour or day. If you exceed this limit, then your computer will be blocked or blacklisted. This is also the case for the LOC API. We want to avoid that from happening when doing these exercises.\n",
