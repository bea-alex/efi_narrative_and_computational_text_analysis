    "\n",
    "This introduction to Jupyter Notebook and Python is part of the EFI Narrative and Computational Text Analysis pre-intenisive and is self-taught. It's set up to run on the University of Edinburgh's Noteable service which means that it can be done on a browser and works on different operating systems (Windows, Linux or Mac). You can complete this introduction at any time during the pre-intensive of this course but we ask you to have it completed before the intensive. \n",

    "## 1. Prerequisites \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction is aimed at students without any prior experience with text analysis of data sets.  You will benefit from knowing how to work in a Jupyter Notebook, how to run code on it and how to do basic coding in the programming language Python, but we will go over each step required in this introduction for anyone with no previous knowledge of these things.\n",

    "We will take it slowly.  If any of the code does not work in your own browser on Noteable, we will do our best to help fix things for you during office hours.  If you end up getting stuck, please don't despair. The goal is to understand the principles of Python and if you can get things running yourself then that's a bonus. "

    "__Float:__ a positive or negative number with a decimal point\n",

    "\n",
    "For this lesson, we'll use [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk), the University of Edinburgh's [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) server. Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations and narrative text.  We interact with Noteable via a browser window rather than using a separate stand-alone application.  So, Noteable makes Jupyter Notebook operating-system-independent which means that there are no prior setup instructions for different operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Starting Noteable\n",
    "To start the introduction within a Jupyter Notebook, you first need to start the Noteable service in your Learn Ultra course (click on the link provided in the course). This will open a new tab in your browser and you have to click \"Start\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up a browser window or tab containing the base directory of where you can store your new notebooks on your computer.  It may take a couple of seconds for the browser window to open.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Creating a new notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new notebook you need to select a location for it on your computer (via the browser window that opened up) and click on \"New\" in the top right corner of Noteable.  You also need to select Python 3 to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Starting a new notebook](../images/starting-notebook-noteable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the new notebook opens you can give it a name by changing the word \"Untitled\" in the first line of the new notebook. Give your notebook a name like ‘My Introduction to Python’.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A new notebook](../images/new-notebook-noteable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the first cell in your new notebook starting with \"In \\[ \\]\".  You can enter Python code into this cell and press \"> Run\" as long as it is marked as \"Code\" in the menu at the top of your notebook.  This will run your code and you will see any output created by the code immediately below it. If you simply press Enter, this won’t run the code. Instead, use the keyboard shortcut for \"Run\" which is Shift-Enter. (To run the cell you are currently on and insert a new cell below, use Alt-Enter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are really useful because they allow you to have your notes and your code in one place:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notes (or Markdown) cells: like what you are reading now, are cells of written text that explain concepts\n",
    "- Code cells: like the `2+3` below are parts of Python programming code, that you can RUN (we will show you how). This means that the code (like `2+3`) will be interpreted by the Python (`oh, I think they are asking me to add two numbers, 2 and 3`) and executed (`that's 5, here you go`). When the code is being run, Python will kindly return you the result, and we will learn later how to show it (print it) in a bit nicer ways."

    "\n",
    "So far we were sort of cheating by \"returning\" the result of our code. Returning happens when Python reaches the end of a cell and isn't told what to do, so it just panics and returns the most recent things it knows about. Returning is not the kindest way to show something on the screen. A nicer way is to kindly ask Python to \"print\" things.\n",
