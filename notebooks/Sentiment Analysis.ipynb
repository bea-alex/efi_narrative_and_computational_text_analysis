    "## 1. What is Sentiment Analysis and where is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analyis is a computational technique used for analysing text to determine its sentiment, for example, whether the text conveys positive, negative or neutral sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often used in commercial settings (and sometimes called opionion mining) and is applied to social media, online review data or surveys, for example, to determine automatically how customers or people express themselves about different brands or products and to analyse what positive and negative words they are using to express themselves.  During political elections sentiment analysis is also used to determine how people feel about different parties and candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large amounts of social media data, like Twitter Tweets or Reddits posts, can be analysed in this way to determine trends over time and monitor where things work well or go wrong."

    "## 2. How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different methods used for performing sentiment analysis.  For example, there are lexicon-lookup methods where each word in a piece of text is checked automatically against a lexicon of positive and negative words to see if it appear in that lexicon.  The more positive or negative words occur the stronger is the sentiment each way.  In this course you will learn how to use a lexicon-based method.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also machine learning and deep learning methods that can be applied to sentiment analysis. This is where data annotated for sentiment by humans is used to train a model which can then be used to classify new data based on what it has learned during training.  We won't cover these approaches in this course, but if you are interested in such learning-based methods which are able to consider the context, as well as representing the meanings of the words in the text mathematically, then check out the two sources below by Lui (2020) and Agarwal et al., (2020).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this course you'll learn how to use [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) for sentiment analysis. TextBlob is a Python library developed to work with another natural language processing (NLP) tool called the Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](https://www.nltk.org)).  NLTK provides access to the lexicons which are required for computing sentiment. So TextBlob uses a lexicon-based approach for performing sentiment analysis.\n",

    "TextBlob computes sentiment using two values: polarity and subjectivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Polarity** is a value between 1 and -1. The closer the value is to 1, the more positive the sentiment of the text is considered to be.  The closer the value is to -1, the more negative it is.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Subjectivity** represents whether a piece of text is more of a personal opinion or something more factual. The subjectivity value lies between 0 and 1.  The closer it is to 1, the more subjective the text is and the closer it is to 0 the more factual it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your friend says to you \"I really hate this day. Everything is going wrong.\" The sentiment of their utterance is overall very negative in polarity, but their statement is also quite subjective.\n",
